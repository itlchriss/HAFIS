In Java, you can use the following code snippet that converts the given problem statement into a JML specification for method contracts:

```java
/**
 * Computes the Hamming distance between two non-negative integers {@code x} and {@code y}.
 * 
 * @param x A non-negative integer.
 * @param y Another non-negative integer.
 * @return The Hamming distance between {@code x} and {@code y}, i.e., the count of bit positions in which their respective binary representations differ.
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException If either {@code x} or {@code y} is negative.
 */
@Pure
public static int hammingDistance(@NonNegative long x, @NonNegative long y) {
    // Method implementation goes here...

    assert x >= 0 : "x must be non-negative";
    assert y >= 0 : "y must be non-negative";
    
    // Postcondition: Return value should be within valid range for Hamming distance.
    assert result() >= 0 && result() <= Integer.SIZE : "Invalid Hamming distance";
}
```

This JML contract specifies that the function computes the Hamming distance between two non-negative integers (`x` and `y`). It also includes preconditions to ensure that both inputs are non-negative using `@NonNegative` annotation from JSR-305 library. Additionally, it has a postcondition to validate the returned result as being within the valid range for Hamming distances (i.e., between 0 and 32). Note that the actual implementation of the method body is not included; replace `"// Method implementation goes here..."` with your own logic.
