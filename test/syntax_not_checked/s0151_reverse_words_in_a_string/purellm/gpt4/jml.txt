/**
 * 151. Reverse Words in a String
 * 
 * Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.
 * 
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.
 * 
 * Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
 * 
 * Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
 * 
 * @param s the input string containing words separated by spaces
 * @return a string with the words in reverse order, separated by a single space
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns "blue is sky the"
 * reverseWords("the sky is blue");
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns "world hello"
 * reverseWords(" hello world ");
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns "example good a"
 * reverseWords("a good example");
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns "Alice Loves Bob"
 * reverseWords(" Bob Loves Alice ");
 * 
 * @example
 * // returns "bob like even not does Alice"
 * reverseWords("Alice does not even like bob");
 * 
 * @constraints
 * 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
 * There is at least one word in `s`.
 * 
 * @followup
 * If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?
