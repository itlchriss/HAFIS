In order to translate the given problem statement into Java Modeling Language (JML), we need to define the method signature along with its preconditions and postcondition annotations. Here's how you can do it in JML:

```java
public class Solution {
    /**
     * Adds two binary numbers represented by strings {@code a} and {@code b}.
     * 
     * @param a A non-null string representing a binary number without leading zeros.
     *          The length should be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
     *          
     * @param b A non-null string representing a binary number without leading zeros.
     *          The length should be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
     *          
     * @return Returns a non-null string representing the sum of {@code a} and {@code b}, also
     *         without any leading zeros.
     */
    public /*@ pure @*/ String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        // Your implementation here...
    }

    /* Precondition: Both input strings are valid binary representations without leading zeros
       Postcondition: Return a non-null string that represents the sum of 'a' and 'b',
                      without any leading zeros */
    //@ requires a!= null &&!a.isEmpty() && allDigitsAreZeroOrOne(a);
    //@ requires b!= null &&!b.isEmpty() && allDigitsAreZeroOrOne(b);
    //@ ensures \result!= null;
    //@ ensures!\result.startsWith("0");
    
    private static boolean allDigitsAreZeroOrOne(/*@ non_null @*/ String s) {
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!(c == '0' || c == '1')) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

The above code defines a `Solution` class with an `addBinary()` method that takes two parameters (`a` and `b`) representing binary numbers as strings. It includes JML comments explaining the purpose of each part of the code, including the method description, parameter descriptions, preconditions, and postcondition. Additionally, there is a helper method called `allDigitsAreZeroOrOne()` which checks whether a given string consists solely of '0' or '1'. This method has been annotated using `@pure` since it doesn't modify any state outside its scope.
