To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to express the constraints and behavior of the problem in a formal specification. JML is used to specify the behavior of Java methods and classes, so we'll assume a method signature and provide a specification for it.

Here's a possible JML specification for the problem:

```java
public class StockTrading {

    /*@ 
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires prices != null && prices.length >= 1 && prices.length <= 5000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < prices.length; 0 <= prices[i] && prices[i] <= 1000);
      @ ensures \result >= 0;
      @ ensures \result == (\max int profit; 
      @     (\exists int[] transactions; 
      @         isValidTransactionSequence(transactions, prices) && 
      @         profit == calculateProfit(transactions, prices)
      @     );
      @ );
      @*/
    public int maxProfitWithCooldown(int[] prices) {
        // Method implementation goes here
    }

    /*@ 
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires transactions != null && prices != null;
      @ ensures \result <==> (
      @     (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < transactions.length; 
      @         transactions[i] == "buy" || transactions[i] == "sell" || transactions[i] == "cooldown"
      @     ) &&
      @     (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < transactions.length - 1; 
      @         !(transactions[i] == "sell" && transactions[i+1] == "buy")
      @     )
      @ );
      @*/
    private boolean isValidTransactionSequence(String[] transactions, int[] prices) {
        // Helper method to check if a transaction sequence is valid
    }

    /*@ 
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires transactions != null && prices != null;
      @ ensures \result >= 0;
      @*/
    private int calculateProfit(String[] transactions, int[] prices) {
        // Helper method to calculate the profit from a transaction sequence
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`maxProfitWithCooldown` Method**: This is the main method that calculates the maximum profit. The JML specification includes:
  - Preconditions (`requires`) to ensure the input array `prices` is not null and its elements are within the specified range.
  - Postconditions (`ensures`) to ensure the result is non-negative and represents the maximum profit achievable with valid transactions.

- **`isValidTransactionSequence` Method**: A helper method to check if a sequence of transactions is valid according to the problem's rules. The JML specification ensures:
  - Each transaction is either "buy", "sell", or "cooldown".
  - No "sell" is immediately followed by a "buy" without a "cooldown".

- **`calculateProfit` Method**: A helper method to calculate the profit from a given sequence of transactions. The JML specification ensures the result is non-negative.

This JML specification provides a formal way to describe the constraints and expected behavior of the solution to the problem.
