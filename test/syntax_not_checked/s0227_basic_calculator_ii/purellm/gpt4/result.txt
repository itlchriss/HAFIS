This JML specification describes the preconditions and postconditions for a method `evaluateExpression` that evaluates a mathematical expression given as a string. The preconditions ensure that the input string `s` is not null, has a valid length, and consists only of digits, operators, and whitespace. The postcondition guarantees that the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer.

The preconditions ensure that the input string `s` is not null, has a valid length, and consists only of digits, operators, and whitespace. The postcondition guarantees that the result is within the range of a 32-bit integer.
