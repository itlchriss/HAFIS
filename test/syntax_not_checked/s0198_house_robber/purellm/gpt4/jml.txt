To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and any invariants that describe the behavior of the function. Here's a possible JML specification for the "House Robber" problem:

```java
//@ requires nums != null;
//@ requires nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 100;
//@ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 0 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 400);
//@ ensures \result == (\max int sum; 
//@     (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
//@         (\forall int j; 0 <= j && j < nums.length; 
//@             (Math.abs(i - j) > 1) ==> (sum == nums[i] + nums[j]))));
//@ ensures \result >= 0;
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    // Implementation of the function
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
  - `nums != null`: The input array `nums` should not be null.
  - `nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 100`: The length of the array should be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
  - `(\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 0 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 400)`: Each element in the array should be between 0 and 400, inclusive.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - `\result == (\max int sum; ...)`: The result should be the maximum sum of money that can be robbed without alerting the police.
  - The condition inside the `\max` quantifier ensures that for any two indices `i` and `j`, if the absolute difference between them is greater than 1 (i.e., they are not adjacent), then the sum of the money from these houses is considered.
  - `\result >= 0`: The result should be non-negative, as the minimum amount of money that can be robbed is 0.

This JML specification provides a formal description of the constraints and expected behavior of the `rob` function.
