Here's my solution written in Java with added comments explaining how it meets the requirements specified by JML (Java Modeling Language):
```java
public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
    // Initialize result array with length same as input array
    int n = nums.length;
    int[] answer = new int[n];

    // Calculate left products
    // For each element at index i, calculate the product of all numbers on its left side
    // Start from the first element (index 0), multiply current value with previous calculated left product
    int leftProduct = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        answer[i] = leftProduct;
        leftProduct *= nums[i];
    }

    // Calculate right products
    // For each element at index i, calculate the product of all numbers on its right side
    // Start from the last element (index n - 1), multiply current value with next calculated right product
    int rightProduct = 1;
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
        answer[i] *= rightProduct;
        rightProduct *= nums[i];
    }

    // Return final result array where answer[i] contains the product of all other elements except nums[i]
    return answer;
}
```
