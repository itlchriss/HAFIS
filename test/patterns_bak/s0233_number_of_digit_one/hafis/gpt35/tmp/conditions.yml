ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 13 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
