ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is not empty and is contained the type_string_ param_haystack_ , the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_string_ param_haystack_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is not empty and is not contained the type_string_ param_haystack_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is not empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is not empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is not empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is not empty and is contained the type_string_ param_haystack_ , the type_integer_ result is the index of the first occurrence of the type_string_ param_needle_ in the type_string_ param_haystack_.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is not empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is not empty and is not contained the type_string_ param_haystack_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
