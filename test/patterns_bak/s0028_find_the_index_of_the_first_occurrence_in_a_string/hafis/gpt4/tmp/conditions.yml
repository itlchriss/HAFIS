ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_needle_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_needle_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
