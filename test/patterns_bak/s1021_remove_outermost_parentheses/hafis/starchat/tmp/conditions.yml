ensures:
- The type_string_ result is equal to valid parentheses string.
- The type_string_ result is equal to primitive decomposition of the type_string_ param_s_.
- The type_string_ result is obtained by removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to empty_str.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_'s values are equal to leftp or are equal to rightp.
- The type_string_ param_s_ is equal to valid parentheses string.
