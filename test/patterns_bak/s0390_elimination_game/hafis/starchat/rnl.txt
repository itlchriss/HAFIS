- The integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 1000000000 and is greater than or equal to 1.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 9, the integer result is equal to 6.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 1.
- The integer result is the last number that remains in the list after applying the algorithm on the list of all integers in the range [1, n] sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- The algorithm is applied recursively until a single number remains.
- The algorithm alternates between left to right and right to left, removing the first number and every other number afterward until reaching the end of the list, and then repeating the previous step again, but this time from right to left, removing the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
- The algorithm is applied until a single number remains.
- The algorithm is deterministic and will always produce the same result for the same input.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the integer parameter.
- The algorithm has a space complexity of O(1), as it does not require any additional data structures to store intermediate results.
- The algorithm can be implemented using a recursive approach or an iterative approach.
- The algorithm can be optimized by using a mathematical formula or pattern to directly calculate the last remaining number without iterating through the list.
- The algorithm can be adapted to handle different scenarios, such as removing every kth number instead of every other number, or applying the algorithm to a circular list.
- The algorithm can be extended to handle more complex scenarios, such as removing numbers based on a given condition or applying the algorithm to a list with duplicate numbers.
- The algorithm can be modified to handle different data types, such as floating-point numbers or strings, by adapting the comparison and removal operations accordingly.
