ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- The type_integer_ result is the last number that remains in the list after applying the algorithm on the list of all integers in the range [1 , n] sorted to a strictly the ascending_order.
- The algorithm is deterministic and will always produce the same result for the same input.
- The algorithm has a space complexity of O tuple_a , as it does not require any additional data structures to store results.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n) , that n is the integer parameter.
