ensures:
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 321 and the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 321.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 321 and the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to negative 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 321.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 21 and the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 120 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 21.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 0 and the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_x_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
