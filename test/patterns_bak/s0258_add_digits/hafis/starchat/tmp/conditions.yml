ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 9.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 38 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is the sum of the digits of the type_integer_ param_num_ until the result has only 1 digit.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
