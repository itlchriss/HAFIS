ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_s_ is contained by the type_string_ param_t_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_s_ is not contained by the type_string_ param_t_.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_t_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains lowercase_alphabets and the type_string_ param_t_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
