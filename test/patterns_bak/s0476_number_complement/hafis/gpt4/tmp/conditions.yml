ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_ param_num_.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 5 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is less_than to 2147483648 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
