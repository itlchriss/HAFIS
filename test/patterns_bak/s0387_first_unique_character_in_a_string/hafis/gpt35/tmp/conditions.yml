- If the type_string_ param_s_ contains a nonrepeating_character , the type_integer_ result is the index of the first occurrence of that character.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ does not contain a nonrepeating_character , the type_integer_ result is negative 1.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
