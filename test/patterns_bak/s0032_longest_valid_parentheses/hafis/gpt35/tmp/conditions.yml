ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 30000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
