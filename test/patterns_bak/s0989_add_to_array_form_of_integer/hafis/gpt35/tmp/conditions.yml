ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the maximum length between the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length and the number of digits in the type_integer_ param_k_ + 1.
- The type_integer_array_ result is the array form of the sum between the type_integer_array_ param_num_ and the type_integer_ param_k_.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s first_element is not_equal to 0 unless the type_integer_array_ param_num_ only contains single_zero.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
