ensures:
- The type_list_ result only contains non_negative_integers.
- The type_list_ result's length is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length_plus1.
- The type_list_ result's summation is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s summation + the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 34 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 181 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 806 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s first_element is not_equal to 0 unless the type_integer_array_ param_num_ only contains single_zero.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
