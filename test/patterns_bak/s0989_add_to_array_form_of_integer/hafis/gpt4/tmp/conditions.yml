ensures:
- The type_list_ result's length is greater_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length.
- The type_list_ result's first_element is not equal to 0 unless the type_list_ result only contains single_zero.
- The integer value represented by the type_list_ result is equal to the sum of the integer value represented by the type_integer_array_ param_num_ and the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 34 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 181 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 806 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_ does not contain leading zeros unless the array only contains single_zero.
