ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , all open brackets in the type_string_ param_s_ are closed by the same type of brackets and in the correct order.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there exists at least 1 open bracket in the type_string_ param_s_ that is not closed by the same type of bracket or it is not in the correct order.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
