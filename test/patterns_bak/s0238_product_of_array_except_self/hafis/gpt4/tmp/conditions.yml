ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- Each element in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the product of all elements in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ except the element at the same index.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 30 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 30.
