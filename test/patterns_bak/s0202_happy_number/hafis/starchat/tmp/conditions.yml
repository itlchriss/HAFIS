ensures:
- The type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a if the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to happy number and the type_string_ strs_b if not.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 , the type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 19 , the type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 , the type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a.
- The type_integer_ result is either the type_string_ strs_a or the type_string_ strs_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
