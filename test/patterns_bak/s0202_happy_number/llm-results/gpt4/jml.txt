To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to express the specifications and constraints in a formal way that can be used to annotate Java code. Here's how you might express the problem in JML:

```java
public class HappyNumber {

    /**
     * Determines if a number is a happy number.
     *
     * @param n the number to check
     * @return true if n is a happy number, false otherwise
     * @requires 1 <= n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE
     * @ensures \result == true <==> (n is a happy number)
     */
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires 1 <= n && n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      @ ensures \result == true <==> isHappy(n);
      @*/
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        // Implementation goes here
    }

    /**
     * Helper method to determine if a number is happy.
     *
     * @param n the number to check
     * @return true if n is a happy number, false otherwise
     */
    /*@ private normal_behavior
      @ requires 1 <= n && n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      @ ensures \result == true <==> (n is a happy number);
      @*/
    private boolean isHappy(int n) {
        // Implementation of the algorithm
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **`@requires`**: Specifies the precondition that the input `n` must satisfy. In this case, `n` must be a positive integer within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
  
- **`@ensures`**: Specifies the postcondition that the method must satisfy. The result of the method should be `true` if and only if `n` is a happy number.

- **`isHappy` method**: This is a placeholder for the actual implementation of the algorithm to determine if a number is happy. The JML annotations describe the expected behavior without providing the implementation details.

This JML specification provides a formal contract for the `isHappy` method, ensuring that it behaves correctly according to the problem description.
