ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to the perfect_square , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is not_equal to the perfect_square , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 14 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
