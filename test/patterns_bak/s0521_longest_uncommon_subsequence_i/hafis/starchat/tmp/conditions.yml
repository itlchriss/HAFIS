ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_a_ and param_b_ are not equal , the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to the length of the longer string .
- If the type_string_ param_a_ and param_b_ are equal , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_a_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_b_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_a_ only contains English lowercase_alphabets and the type_string_ param_b_ only contains English lowercase_alphabets.
