To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to express the problem's constraints, inputs, and expected behavior in a formal specification. Here's how you can represent it:

```java
//@ public class GasStation {

/*@ requires gas != null && cost != null;
  @ requires gas.length == cost.length;
  @ requires 1 <= gas.length && gas.length <= 100000;
  @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length; 0 <= gas[i] && gas[i] <= 10000);
  @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < cost.length; 0 <= cost[i] && cost[i] <= 10000);
  @
  @ ensures (\result == -1) <==>
  @     (\forall int start; 0 <= start && start < gas.length;
  @         (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length;
  @             (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < gas.length;
  @                 gas[(start + j) % gas.length] - cost[(start + j) % gas.length]) < 0));
  @
  @ ensures (\result != -1) ==> 
  @     (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length;
  @         (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < gas.length;
  @             gas[(\result + j) % gas.length] - cost[(\result + j) % gas.length]) >= 0);
  @
  @ ensures (\result != -1) ==> 
  @     (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length;
  @         (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < gas.length;
  @             gas[(\result + j) % gas.length] - cost[(\result + j) % gas.length]) >= 0);
  @
  @ ensures (\result != -1) ==> 
  @     (\forall int start; 0 <= start && start < gas.length && start != \result;
  @         (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length;
  @             (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < gas.length;
  @                 gas[(start + j) % gas.length] - cost[(start + j) % gas.length]) < 0));
  @*/
public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
//@ }
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**: 
  - The arrays `gas` and `cost` are not null and have the same length.
  - The length of the arrays is between 1 and 100,000.
  - Each element in `gas` and `cost` is between 0 and 10,000.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - If the result is `-1`, it means there is no starting point from which you can complete the circuit. This is expressed by checking that for every possible starting point, there exists a point in the journey where the cumulative gas is less than the cumulative cost.
  - If the result is not `-1`, it means there is a valid starting point. The conditions ensure that starting from this point, you can complete the circuit without running out of gas.
  - The result is unique, meaning no other starting point can complete the circuit.

This JML specification captures the essence of the problem, ensuring that the implementation adheres to the constraints and expected behavior described in the problem statement.
