ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1 if there exists no solution to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the starting gas station's index if it is possible to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
