ensures:
- If the type_integer_ result is not equal to negative 1 , there exists a solution that allows the car to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1 , there does not exist a solution that allows the car to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
