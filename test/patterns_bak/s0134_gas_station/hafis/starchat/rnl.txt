- The length of the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `cost`.
- The length of the integer array parameter `gas` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.
- The length of the integer array parameter `cost` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.
- All values in the integer array parameter `gas` are less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 0.
- All values in the integer array parameter `cost` are less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 0.
- If the integer result is not equal to -1, there exists a solution that allows the car to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- If the integer result is equal to -1, there does not exist a solution that allows the car to travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction.
- If the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to [1,2,3,4,5] and the integer array parameter `cost` is equal to [3,4,5,1,2], the integer result is equal to 3.
- If the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to [2,3,4] and the integer array parameter `cost` is equal to [3,4,3], the integer result is equal to -1.
