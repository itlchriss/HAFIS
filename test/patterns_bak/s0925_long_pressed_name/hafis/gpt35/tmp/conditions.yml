ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_typed_ accontains the type_string_ param_name_ , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_typed_ does not accontain the type_string_ param_name_ , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If in the type_string_ param_name_ is long pressed in the type_string_ param_typed_ , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If in the type_string_ param_name_ is not long pressed in the type_string_ param_typed_ , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_name_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_typed_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_name_ only contains lowercase_alphabets and the type_string_ param_typed_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
