- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 5000 and is greater than or equal to 1.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique and are within the range of -104 to 104.
- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in ascending order, but it is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index.
- The length of the integer parameter `target` is equal to 1.
- The integer parameter `target` is within the range of -104 to 104.
- The integer result is within the range of -1 to the length of the integer array parameter `nums` minus 1.
