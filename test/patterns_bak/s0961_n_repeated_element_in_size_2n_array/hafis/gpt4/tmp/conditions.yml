ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is contained by the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is equal to the type_integer_ the type_string_ strs_a.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ contains the type_string_ strs_a unique elements.
- 1 element in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is repeated the type_character_ chrs_a times.
