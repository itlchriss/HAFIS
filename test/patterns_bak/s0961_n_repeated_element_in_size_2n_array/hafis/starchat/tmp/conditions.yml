ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is an even number.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ contains n + 1 unique elements.
- Exactly 1 element of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is repeated n times.
