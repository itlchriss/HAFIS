ensures:
- The type_string_ result does not contain leading_or_trailing_spaces.
- The type_string_ result should only have a single space separating the words.
- Multiple spaces between 2 words in the type_string_ result is reduced to a single space.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
requires:
