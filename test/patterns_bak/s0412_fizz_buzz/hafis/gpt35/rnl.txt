- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- The length of the string array result is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- If the index `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, the string at index `i` in the string array result is equal to "FizzBuzz".
- If the index `i` is divisible by 3, the string at index `i` in the string array result is equal to "Fizz".
- If the index `i` is divisible by 5, the string at index `i` in the string array result is equal to "Buzz".
- If none of the above conditions are true, the string at index `i` in the string array result is equal to the string representation of `i`.
