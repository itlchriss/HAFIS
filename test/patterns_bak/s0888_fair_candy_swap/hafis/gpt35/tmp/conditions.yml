ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s summation - the type_integer_array_ result's first_element is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s summation - the type_integer_array_ result's second_element .
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s summation is not_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s summation.
