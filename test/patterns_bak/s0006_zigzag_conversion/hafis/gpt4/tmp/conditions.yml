ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 1 , the type_string_ result is equal to the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 3 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 4 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 1 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
- The type_integer_ param_numRows_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
