- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.
- The integer parameter `k` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 0.
- If the boolean result is equal to true, there exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the values at these indices are equal and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to the integer parameter `k`.
- If the boolean result is equal to false, there are no two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the integer array parameter `nums` such that the values at these indices are equal and the absolute difference between `i` and `j` is less than or equal to the integer parameter `k`.
