ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exist at least 2 unique indices the type_character_ chrs_a and the type_character_ chrs_b in the array such that the type_string_ strs_c and the type_string_ strs_d.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there exist no 2 unique indices the type_character_ chrs_a and the type_character_ chrs_b in the array such that the type_string_ strs_c and the type_string_ strs_d.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 3 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 2 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ only contains checking_integer.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
