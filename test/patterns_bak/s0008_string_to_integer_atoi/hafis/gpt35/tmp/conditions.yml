ensures:
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 0 , the type_string_ param_s_ does not contain digits.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 2147483648 and the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 4193 and the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4193.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 42 and the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 42.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 42 and the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 42.
