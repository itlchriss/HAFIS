ensures:
- The type_string_ result is the type_string_ param_num1_ + the type_string_ param_num2_.
- The type_string_ result is represented by a string.
- The type_string_ result is equal to the sum of the integer values represented by the type_string_ param_num1_ and the type_string_ param_num2_.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_num1_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_num2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_num1_ only contains digits and the type_string_ param_num1_'s first_element is equal to the chry_a.
- The type_string_ param_num2_ only contains digits and the type_string_ param_num2_'s first_element is equal to the chry_a.
