ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 9.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
