To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for the method that solves the problem. Here's a possible JML specification for the problem:

```java
/*@
  requires nums != null;
  requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
            -1000000000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 1000000000);
  ensures \result >= 0;
  ensures (\exists int[] seq; 
           (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < seq.length - 1; seq[i] + 1 == seq[i + 1]) &&
           (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < seq.length; 
            (\exists int j; 0 <= j && j < nums.length; seq[i] == nums[j])) &&
           seq.length == \result);
  ensures (\forall int[] seq; 
           (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < seq.length - 1; seq[i] + 1 == seq[i + 1]) &&
           (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < seq.length; 
            (\exists int j; 0 <= j && j < nums.length; seq[i] == nums[j])) ==>
           seq.length <= \result);
@*/
public int longestConsecutive(int[] nums) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
  - The input array `nums` must not be null.
  - Each element in `nums` must be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - The result (`\result`) must be non-negative.
  - There must exist a sequence `seq` such that:
    - The sequence is consecutive, i.e., each element is one more than the previous.
    - Every element in the sequence `seq` must be present in the input array `nums`.
    - The length of this sequence is equal to the result.
  - For any sequence `seq` that is consecutive and whose elements are all in `nums`, its length must be less than or equal to the result.

This JML specification describes the expected behavior of the `longestConsecutive` method, ensuring it finds the longest consecutive sequence in the input array.
