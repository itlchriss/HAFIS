ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an integer the type_character_ chrs_a such that the type_character_ chrs_b is equal to 3 raised to the power of the type_character_ chrs_c.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there does not exist an integer the type_character_ chrs_a such that the type_character_ chrs_b is equal to 3 raised to the power of the type_character_ chrs_c.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
