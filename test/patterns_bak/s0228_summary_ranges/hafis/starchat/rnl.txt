- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 20 and is greater than or equal to 0.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 2147483647 and is greater than or equal to -2147483648.
- All the values of `nums` are unique.
- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in ascending order.
- The list result contains strings that represent the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly.
- Each string in the list result is in the format "a->b" if `a!= b` or "a" if `a == b`.
- The list result does not contain any integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.
- The list result is sorted in ascending order.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,1,2,4,5,7], the list result is equal to ["0->2","4->5","7"].
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,2,3,4,6,8,9], the list result is equal to ["0","2->4","6","8->9"].
