ensures:
- The type_list_ result contains strings that represent the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array .
- Each string in the type_list_ result is in the format stry_a if the type_string_ strs_a or stry_b if the type_string_ strs_b.
- The type_list_ result does not contain any integer the type_character_ chrs_a such that the type_character_ chrs_b is in 1 of the ranges but not in the type_string_ strs_c.
- The type_list_ result is sorted to the ascending_order.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to the type_string_array_ str_seqa.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to the type_string_array_ str_seqa.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 20 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is sorted to the ascending_order.
