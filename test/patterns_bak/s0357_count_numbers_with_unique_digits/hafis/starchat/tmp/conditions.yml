ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 91.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 10.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 739.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 4 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5275.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 5 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 32491.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1688228.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 7 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 83621143.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 8 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 385875490.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 8 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
