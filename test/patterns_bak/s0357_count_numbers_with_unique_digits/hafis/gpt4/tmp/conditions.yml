ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ int_expr.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 91.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 8 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
