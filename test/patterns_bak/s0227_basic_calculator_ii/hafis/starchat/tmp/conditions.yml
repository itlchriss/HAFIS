ensures:
- All results is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 7.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 300000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains arithexprspace.
- The type_string_ param_s_ is equal to valid expression.
