ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to the smallest possible sum of a contiguous subarray and is less_than_or_equal to the largest possible sum of a contiguous subarray.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 23.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
