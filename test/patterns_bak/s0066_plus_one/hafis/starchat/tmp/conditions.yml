ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ result does not contain any leading 0's.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
