ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result is equal to permutation of all the integers in the range [0 , n] that n is the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_a.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_a.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_a.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ are equal to checking_character_sequence_.
