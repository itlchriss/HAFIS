- The length of the integer array parameter `numbers` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 2.
- All values in the integer array parameter `numbers` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.
- The integer parameter `target` is less than or equal to 1000000000 and is greater than or equal to -1000000000.
- The integer array result contains exactly two elements representing the indices of the two numbers in the integer array parameter `numbers` that add up to the integer parameter `target`.
