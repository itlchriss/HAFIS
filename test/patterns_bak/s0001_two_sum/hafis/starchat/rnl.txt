- The length of the integer array parameter `numbers` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 2.
- All values in the integer array parameter `numbers` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and is greater than or equal to -1000000000.
- The integer parameter `target` is less than or equal to 1000000000 and is greater than or equal to -1000000000.
- The integer array result is of length 2.
- The values in the integer array result are less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `numbers` and is greater than or equal to 0.
- The sum of the values at the indices in the integer array result is equal to the integer parameter `target`.
- The values at the indices in the integer array result are unique.
- The integer array result is sorted in ascending order.
- If there are multiple valid answers, return any one of them.
- The algorithm should have a time complexity of less than O(n^2).
