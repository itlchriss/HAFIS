ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The summation at the indices in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the type_integer_ param_target_.
- All values at the indices in the type_integer_array_ result are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ result is sorted to the ascending_order.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
