ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The summation at the indices specified in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the type_integer_ param_target_.
- The indices in the type_integer_array_ result are unique.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
