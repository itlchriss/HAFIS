ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is always an integer.
- The type_integer_ result is always the maximum possible sum of the minimum values of the pairs.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 9.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is always even.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
