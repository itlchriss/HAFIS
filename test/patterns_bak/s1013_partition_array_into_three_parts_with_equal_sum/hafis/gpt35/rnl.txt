- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is less than or equal to 50000 and is greater than or equal to 3.
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are less than or equal to 10000 and are greater than or equal to -10000.
- The boolean result is true if we can find indexes `i + 1 < j` such that the sum of the elements from index 0 to i is equal to the sum of the elements from index i+1 to j-1 and is equal to the sum of the elements from index j to the end of the array.
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1], the boolean result is true.
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1], the boolean result is false.
