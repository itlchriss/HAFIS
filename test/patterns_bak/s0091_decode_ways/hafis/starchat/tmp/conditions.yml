ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 230.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
