ensures:
- The type_list_ result is not empty and the type_list_ result's length is less_than_or_equal to 2.
- If the type_list_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_list_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_list_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_list_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 50000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_list_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
