- The integer parameters `x` and `y` are less than or equal to 2^31 - 1 and are greater than or equal to 0.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the number of positions at which the corresponding bits of `x` and `y` are different.
- If the integer parameters `x` and `y` are equal to 1 and 4 respectively, the integer result is equal to 2.
- If the integer parameters `x` and `y` are equal to 3 and 1 respectively, the integer result is equal to 1.
