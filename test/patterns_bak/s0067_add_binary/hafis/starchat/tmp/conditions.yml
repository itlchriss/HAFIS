ensures:
- The type_string_ result is equal to binary string and does not contain leading zeros except for the 0 itself.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_a_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_b_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_a_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ and the type_string_ param_b_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
- The type_string_ param_a_ and param_b_ do not contain leading zeros except for the 0 itself.
