ensures:
- The type_string_ result is not empty.
- The type_string_ result's first_element is not the chry_a.
- The type_string_ result does not contain consecutive the chry_as.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 100 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_a.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to negative 7 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_a.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 0 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_a.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000000.
