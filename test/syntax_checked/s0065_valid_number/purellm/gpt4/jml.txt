To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for a method that checks if a string is a valid number. Here's how you might express this in JML:

```java
public class ValidNumberChecker {

    /*@ 
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires s != null && s.length() >= 1 && s.length() <= 20;
      @ ensures \result == true <==> (
      @     (\exists int i; 0 <= i < s.length(); 
      @         (s.charAt(i) == '+' || s.charAt(i) == '-' || ('0' <= s.charAt(i) && s.charAt(i) <= '9') || s.charAt(i) == '.' || s.charAt(i) == 'e' || s.charAt(i) == 'E')
      @     ) &&
      @     (\forall int i; 0 <= i < s.length(); 
      @         (s.charAt(i) == '+' || s.charAt(i) == '-' || ('0' <= s.charAt(i) && s.charAt(i) <= '9') || s.charAt(i) == '.' || s.charAt(i) == 'e' || s.charAt(i) == 'E')
      @     ) &&
      @     isValidNumber(s)
      @ );
      @*/
    public boolean isValidNumber(String s) {
        // Implementation of the method
    }

    /*@ 
      @ private normal_behavior
      @ requires s != null && s.length() >= 1 && s.length() <= 20;
      @ ensures \result == true <==> (
      @     // Logic to determine if s is a valid number according to the problem description
      @ );
      @*/
    private boolean isValidNumber(String s) {
        // Actual logic to check if the string is a valid number
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**: The input string `s` must not be null, and its length must be between 1 and 20, inclusive.
- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**: The result of the method should be `true` if and only if the string `s` is a valid number according to the specified rules.
- **Helper Method (`isValidNumber`)**: This private method would contain the actual logic to determine if the string is a valid number. The JML specification for this method would need to be detailed with the exact logic for checking the validity of the number, which is complex and involves checking the structure of the string as described in the problem.

This JML specification provides a high-level contract for the `isValidNumber` method, ensuring that it adheres to the constraints and expected behavior outlined in the problem description. The actual implementation of the method would need to parse the string and verify its structure according to the rules for valid numbers.
