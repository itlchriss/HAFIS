The following code snippet presents my solution for finding the minimal number of moves required to equate all elements within an integer array according to the problem's constraints and requirements. The algorithm implemented here is based on sorting the given array first, which allows us to leverage its properties effectively. After arranging the numbers in ascending order, we identify the median value as it represents the target point where all elements should be moved towards. By calculating the absolute difference between each element and the median, we accumulate the total count of necessary adjustments. This approach ensures that every single element contributes proportionally to reaching the balanced state with respect to the overall sum minimization objective. My implementation adheres strictly to Java syntax conventions while maintaining readability through clear variable naming and logical steps. Here is my solution encapsulated within the provided method signature:
```java
public int minMoves2(int[] nums) {
    Arrays.sort(nums); // Sorting the input array
    int n = nums.length;
    long midValue = nums[(n - 1) / 2]; // Identifying the middle value (median)
    long moves = 0;

    for (int num : nums) {
        moves += Math.abs(num - midValue); // Accumulating the total moves
    }

    return (int) moves; // Casting result back to int since problem guarantees fit into 32-bit integer
}
```
