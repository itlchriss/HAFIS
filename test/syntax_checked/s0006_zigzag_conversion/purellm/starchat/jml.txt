In order to translate the provided problem statement into Java Modeling Language (JML), we need to understand what each part of the original description represents within the context of software specifications. Here's how it can be done:

1. Problem Description:
   - The task involves converting a string from its standard format to a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows.
   - The resulting output should be obtained by reading the characters row by row.

2. Method Signature:
   - In the original C++ function signature, there are two parameters:
     ```cpp
     string convert(string s, int numRows); 
     ```
   - This translates directly to the following method declaration in JML:
     ```java
     public String convert(@NonNull @Model("String") String s, @IntRange(from=1,to=1000) int numRows) {... }
     ```
    Note: We've added annotations `@NonNull`, `@Model("String")`, and `@IntRange(from=1,to=1000)` to indicate non-null input strings and valid range for `numRows`.

3. Constraints:
   - The length of the input string (`s`) must fall between 1 and 1000 characters.
   - Only English letters (both lower case and upper case), commas, and periods are allowed as characters in the string.
   - The number of rows (`numRows`) must be an integer value ranging from 1 to 1000.

4. Examples:
   - Example 1:
     Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
     Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

   - Example 2:
     Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
     Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"

   - Example 3:
     Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
     Output: "A"

Here's the complete JML specification based on the translated problem statement:
```java
import org.jmlspecs.lang.*;

public class Solution {

    /**
     * Converts a string from its standard format to a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows.
     *
     * @param s       Non-null string containing only English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'. Length must be between 1 and 1000.
     * @param numRows Number of rows in the zigzag pattern. Must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
     * @return        Resultant string after applying the zigzag transformation.
     */
    public String convert(@NonNull @Model("String") String s, @IntRange(from=1,to=1000) int numRows) {
        // Implementation goes here...
    }
}
