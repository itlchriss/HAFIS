The following code snippet presents my solution for determining whether I have a winning strategy in the classic Nim Game using Java's formal specification language (JML). This approach leverages the mathematical property that if the total number of stones `n` is not divisible by four, then the player making the initial move has a guaranteed victory. By applying JML annotations, we ensure that our method adheres to its specifications regarding input validation and output correctness. My implementation follows these steps:

1. Verify that the provided integer `n` falls within the specified range. If not, throw an IllegalArgumentException indicating invalid input.
2. Apply the logical condition to determine if the current player has a winning position based on the parity of `n`. Return true when `n % 4!= 0`; otherwise, return false.
```java
public class Solution {
  /**
   * Determine if the current player has a winning strategy in the Nim Game given the number of stones 'n'.
   * @param n the number of stones in the heap
   * @return true if the current player wins; false otherwise
   */
  public /*@ pure @*/ boolean canWinNim(int n) {
    // Input Validation
    assert n > 0 : "Invalid input! Number of stones must be greater than zero.";
    
    // Winning Strategy: Player wins if the number of stones is not divisible by four
    return n % 4!= 0;
  }
}
```
