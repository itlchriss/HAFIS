ensures:
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is greater_than to 1 , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is sorted to the descending_order .
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is equal to 0 or the type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is unchanged .
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is not null.
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
