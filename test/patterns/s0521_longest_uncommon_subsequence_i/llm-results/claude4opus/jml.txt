Looking at this problem, I need to understand what constitutes an "uncommon subsequence" - it's a subsequence of one string but not the other.

The key insight is that if two strings are different, then each string itself is a subsequence of itself but not a subsequence of the other string. Therefore, the longest uncommon subsequence would be the longer of the two strings.

If the strings are identical, then every subsequence of one is also a subsequence of the other, so no uncommon subsequence exists.

Here's the JML specification:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ requires a != null && b != null;
      @ requires a.length() >= 1 && a.length() <= 100;
      @ requires b.length() >= 1 && b.length() <= 100;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < a.length(); 
      @           'a' <= a.charAt(i) && a.charAt(i) <= 'z');
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < b.length(); 
      @           'a' <= b.charAt(i) && b.charAt(i) <= 'z');
      @ ensures a.equals(b) ==> \result == -1;
      @ ensures !a.equals(b) ==> \result == Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int findLUSlength(String a, String b) {
        // Implementation
        return a.equals(b) ? -1 : Math.max(a.length(), b.length());
    }
}
```

The JML specification captures:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - Both strings are non-null
   - Length constraints (1-100 characters)
   - Character constraints (lowercase English letters only)

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - If strings are equal, return -1
   - If strings are different, return the length of the longer string

The `pure` modifier indicates that this method has no side effects and only depends on its parameters.
