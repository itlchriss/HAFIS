ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to the type_string_ param_b_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is not_equal to the type_string_ param_b_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to the maximum between the type_string_ param_a_'s length and the type_string_ param_b_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_a_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_b_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_a_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_b_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
