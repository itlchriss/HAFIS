ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
