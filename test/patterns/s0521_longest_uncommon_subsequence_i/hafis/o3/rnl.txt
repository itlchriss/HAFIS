- The length of the string parameter `b` is less than or equal to 100 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `a` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The string parameter `b` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to the string parameter `b`, the integer result is equal to -1.  
- If the string parameter `a` is not equal to the string parameter `b`, the integer result is equal to the greater between the length of the string parameter `a` and the length of the string parameter `b`.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to "aba" and the string parameter `b` is equal to "cdc", the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to "aaa" and the string parameter `b` is equal to "bbb", the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to "aaa" and the string parameter `b` is equal to "aaa", the integer result is equal to -1.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -1 and is less than or equal to 100.
