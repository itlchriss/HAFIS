- prerequisite every element in int[] 'data' is an int value between zero and two hundred fifty five inclusive  
- result boolean result is true only when the entire sequence in int[] 'data' conforms to UTF 8 encoding where a one byte character begins with bit pattern zero followed by seven data bits and an n bytes character begins with n leading one bits followed by a zero and exactly n minus one continuation bytes each beginning with bit pattern one zero  
- result boolean result is false when the sequence in int[] 'data' violates any UTF 8 rule stated above
