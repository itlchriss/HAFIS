ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_array_ param_data_ is equal to valid UTF-8 encoding.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_array_ param_data_ does not represent a valid UTF-8 encoding.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_data_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_data_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_data_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 20000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_data_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 255 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
