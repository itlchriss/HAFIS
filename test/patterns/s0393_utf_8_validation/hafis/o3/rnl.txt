- All values in the integer array parameter `data` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 255.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer array parameter `data` represents a valid UTF-8 encoded sequence of bytes.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer array parameter `data` does not represent a valid UTF-8 encoded sequence of bytes.  
- If the integer array parameter `data` is equal to [197,130,1], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `data` is equal to [235,140,4], the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
