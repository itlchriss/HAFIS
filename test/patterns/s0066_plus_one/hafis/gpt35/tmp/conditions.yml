ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result is the large integer obtained by incrementing the integer represented by the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ by 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_digits_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_digits_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_digits_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_digits_'s first_element is not_equal to 0.
