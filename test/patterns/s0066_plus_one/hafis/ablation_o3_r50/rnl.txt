(15s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `digits` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `digits` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 9.  
- The first value of the integer array parameter `digits` is not equal to 0 unless the length of the integer array parameter `digits` is equal to 1.  
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `digits` or is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `digits` plus 1.  
- The integer value represented by the integer array result is equal to the integer value represented by the integer array parameter `digits` plus 1.  
- All the values in the integer array result are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 9.  
- The first value of the integer array result is equal to 1 if and only if all the values in the integer array parameter `digits` are equal to 9.  
- If the integer array parameter `digits` is equal to [1,2,3], the integer array result is equal to [1,2,4].  
- If the integer array parameter `digits` is equal to [4,3,2,1], the integer array result is equal to [4,3,2,2].  
- If the integer array parameter `digits` is equal to [0], the integer array result is equal to [1].  
- If the integer array parameter `digits` is equal to [9], the integer array result is equal to [1,0].
