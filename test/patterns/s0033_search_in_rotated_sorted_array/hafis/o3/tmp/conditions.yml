ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1 , the type_integer_ param_target_ is not an element of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 , the value at the integer index equal to the type_integer_ result in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to the type_integer_ param_target_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is sorted to the ascending_order or is equal to rotated ascending array.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
