- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 10000 and are greater than or equal to -10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique.  
- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in ascending order or is a rotated ascending array.  
- The integer parameter `target` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to -10000.  
- The integer result is less than the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and is greater than or equal to -1.  
- If the integer result is equal to -1, the integer parameter `target` is not an element of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the integer result is greater than or equal to 0, the value at the integer index equal to the integer result in the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to the integer parameter `target`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 4.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 3, the integer result is equal to -1.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to -1.
