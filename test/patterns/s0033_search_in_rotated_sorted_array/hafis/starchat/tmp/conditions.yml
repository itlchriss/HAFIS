ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is in the range of negative 1 to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length - 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_target_ is present in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to the index of the first occurrence of the type_integer_ param_target_ in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_ param_target_ is not contained by the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 5000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are unique and are in the range of negative 104 to 104.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is sorted to the ascending_order , but it is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index.
- The type_integer_ param_target_'s length is equal to 1.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 104 and is less_than_or_equal to 104.
