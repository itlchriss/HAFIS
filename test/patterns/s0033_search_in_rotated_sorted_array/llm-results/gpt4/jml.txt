To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to express the constraints and requirements of the problem in a formal specification. Here's how you might write a JML specification for the problem:

```java
/*@
  requires nums != null;
  requires nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 5000;
  requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i < nums.length; -10000 <= nums[i] <= 10000);
  requires (\forall int i, j; 0 <= i < j < nums.length; nums[i] != nums[j]);
  requires (\exists int k; 0 <= k < nums.length; 
              (\forall int i; 0 <= i < nums.length - 1; 
                (i < k ==> nums[i] < nums[i+1]) && 
                (i >= k ==> nums[i] < nums[(i+1) % nums.length])));
  requires -10000 <= target <= 10000;
  
  ensures (\result == -1 ==> (\forall int i; 0 <= i < nums.length; nums[i] != target));
  ensures (\result != -1 ==> (0 <= \result < nums.length && nums[\result] == target));
  ensures \result == -1 || \result == (\exists int i; 0 <= i < nums.length; nums[i] == target);
@*/
public static int searchInRotatedSortedArray(int[] nums, int target) {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
  - `nums` is not null.
  - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 5000.
  - Each element in `nums` is between -10,000 and 10,000.
  - All elements in `nums` are unique.
  - There exists a pivot `k` such that the array is sorted in ascending order before and after the pivot.
  - The `target` is between -10,000 and 10,000.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - If the result is `-1`, then the `target` is not present in `nums`.
  - If the result is not `-1`, then it is a valid index within `nums` and `nums[\result]` is equal to `target`.
  - The result is either `-1` or a valid index where `target` is found in `nums`.

This JML specification provides a formal contract for the `searchInRotatedSortedArray` method, ensuring that the input constraints are met and the output is as expected.
