(11s elapsed)- String `s` prerequisite length is at least one and at most one hundred thousand  
- String `s` prerequisite every character is either uppercase I or uppercase D  
- int[] result ensures length equals length of String `s` plus one  
- int[] result ensures it contains each integer from zero to length of String `s` exactly once  
- int[] result ensures that for every index i with i greater than or equal to zero and i less than length of String `s` when the character at index i in String `s` is uppercase I then the element at index i in int[] result is less than the element at index i plus one in int[] result  
- int[] result ensures that for every index i with i greater than or equal to zero and i less than length of String `s` when the character at index i in String `s` is uppercase D then the element at index i in int[] result is greater than the element at index i plus one in int[] result
