ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length_plus1.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are unique.
- If the character at index i of the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to the chry_a , the value at index i of the type_integer_array_ result is less_than to the value at index i + 1 of the type_integer_array_ result .
- If the character at index i of the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to the chry_a , the value at index i of the type_integer_array_ result is greater_than to the value at index i + 1 of the type_integer_array_ result .
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to valid permutation that the pattern matches stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to valid permutation that the pattern matches stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to valid permutation that the pattern matches stry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the chry_a and the chry_b.
