Feel free to adapt the method name or visibility to your code base – the behavioural part of the
specification (everything between `/*@` and `@*/`) already captures the whole textual
description given in the statement.

```java
/**
 * Reconstructs one permutation {@code perm} of the integers 0 … n
 * (where n = {@code s.length()}) that fulfils the “DI” constraints
 * described in LeetCode #942.
 */
 /*@
   public normal_behavior
     //  ──  PRE-CONDITIONS  ────────────────────────────────────────────────
     requires s != null;
     requires 1 <= s.length() && s.length() <= 100000;
     requires (\forall int k; 0 <= k && k < s.length();
                  s.charAt(k) == 'I' || s.charAt(k) == 'D');

     //  ──  POST-CONDITIONS  ───────────────────────────────────────────────
     ensures \result != null;
     ensures \result.length == s.length() + 1;

     //  every value 0 … n occurs exactly once
     ensures (\forall int v; 0 <= v && v <= s.length();
                (\exists int idx; 0 <= idx && idx < \result.length;
                                 \result[idx] == v));
     ensures (\forall int i, j; 0 <= i && i < j && j < \result.length;
                                \result[i] != \result[j]);

     //  order constraints imposed by the characters in s
     ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < s.length();
                (s.charAt(i) == 'I' ==> \result[i]   < \result[i+1]) &&
                (s.charAt(i) == 'D' ==> \result[i]   > \result[i+1]));

     //  no visible side effects except object creation
     assignable \strictly_nothing;
 @*/
public int[] diStringMatch(String s);
```

Explanation of the main clauses:

• `requires`  
  – input must be non-null, have length 1 … 100 000, and contain only the
    characters ‘I’ and ‘D’.

• `ensures` (array shape)  
  – the returned array is non-null and has length n + 1.

• `ensures` (permutation property)  
  – every integer in 0 … n appears exactly once (two clauses: existence and
    pairwise difference).

• `ensures` (“DI” property)  
  – for every position i the array values respect the ‘I’/‘D’ relation to the
    next element.

• `assignable \strictly_nothing`  
  – the method must not modify any pre-existing state; allocation of the result
    array is still allowed.

This contract is faithful to the original specification and allows any correct
implementation that produces one permissible permutation.
