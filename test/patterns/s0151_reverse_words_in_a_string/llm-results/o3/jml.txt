The Java code is only a stub – the interesting part is the JML specification
(the clauses that start with `/*@ … @*/).  You can copy-and-paste this into a file
and run either OpenJML or another JML checker to verify an implementation of
`reverseWords`.

```java
public final class ReverseWords {

    /*------------------------------------------------------------------
     *  A model-level helper that turns a string into the sequence of
     *  its words.  The method is declared “model’’ and “pure’’ so it is
     *  used for specification purposes only; an implementation body is
     *  not required by JML tools.
     *-----------------------------------------------------------------*/

    /*@
      public pure model String[] words(String str);

      //  Post-conditions for the helper (documentation only):
      //    – never returns null;
      //    – each returned element is a non-empty string that contains
      //      no space characters.
      ensures \result != null;
      ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i < \result.length;
                  \result[i] != null && \result[i].length() > 0);
      ensures (\forall int i,j; 0 <= i < \result.length &&
                                0 <= j < \result[i].length();
                  \result[i].charAt(j) != ' ');
    @*/


    /*------------------------------------------------------------------
     *  The routine to be implemented.
     *-----------------------------------------------------------------*/
    /*@
      public normal_behavior
        // PRE-CONDITIONS
        requires s != null;
        requires 1 <= s.length() && s.length() <= 10000;
        // there is at least one non-blank character  ==>  at least one word
        requires (\exists int k; 0 <= k < s.length();  s.charAt(k) != ' ');

        // POST-CONDITIONS
        // 1)  The word order is exactly the reverse of the original.
        ensures words(\result).length == words(s).length;
        ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i < words(\result).length;
                    words(\result)[i].equals(
                        words(s)[words(s).length - 1 - i] ));

        // 2)  Formatting requirements:
        //     a) no leading or trailing blanks
        ensures \result.charAt(0)                  != ' ';
        ensures \result.charAt(\result.length()-1) != ' ';

        //     b) a single blank separates consecutive words (no “  ”)
        ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i < \result.length()-1;
                    !(\result.charAt(i) == ' ' &&
                      \result.charAt(i+1) == ' '));

        // 3)  The result is never null
        ensures \result != null;
    @*/
    public static /*@ pure @*/ String reverseWords(final String s) {
        // --- implementation goes here ---
        return null;  // stub

Explanation of the most important clauses
-----------------------------------------
1. `words(String str)` is a *model* method:  
   – It can be used freely in pre- and post-conditions.  
   – It denotes “the sequence of words obtained from `str`, where a word is a maximal, non-empty sequence of non-space characters”.

2. Functional behaviour (`ensures words(\result)…`)  
   guarantees the result is precisely the reverse sequence of the input words.

3. Formatting clauses ensure the returned string:
   • has no leading/trailing spaces;  
   • has no occurrences of two consecutive spaces.

4. The pre-conditions encode all constraints from the original exercise:
   length bounds, non-null input, and the existence of at least one word.

Implement any algorithm you like under this contract; the JML tool will
check that the implementation fulfils the formal specification.
