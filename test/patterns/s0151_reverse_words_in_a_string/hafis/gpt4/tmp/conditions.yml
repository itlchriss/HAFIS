ensures:
- The type_string_ result contains words in reverse order compared to the type_string_ param_s_.
- The type_string_ result contains a single space between words and does not contain leading_or_trailing_spaces.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
