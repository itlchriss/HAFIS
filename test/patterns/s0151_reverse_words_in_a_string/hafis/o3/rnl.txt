(15s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- The string parameter `s` consists only of English letters digits and space characters.  
- The string result contains no leading space characters and contains no trailing space characters.  
- Any two consecutive sequences of non space characters in the string result are separated by exactly one space character.  
- The number of sequences of non space characters in the string result is equal to the number of sequences of non space characters in the string parameter `s`.  
- The order of the sequences of non space characters in the string result is the reverse order of the sequences of non space characters in the string parameter `s`.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "the sky is blue", the string result is equal to "blue is sky the".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to " hello world ", the string result is equal to "world hello".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "a good example", the string result is equal to "example good a".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to " Bob Loves Alice ", the string result is equal to "Alice Loves Bob".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "Alice does not even like bob", the string result is equal to "bob like even not does Alice".
