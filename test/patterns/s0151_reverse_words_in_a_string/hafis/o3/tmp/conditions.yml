ensures:
- The type_string_ result contains no leading space characters and contains no trailing space characters.
- Any 2 consecutive sequences of non space characters in the type_string_ result are separated by 1 space character.
- The number of sequences of non space characters in the type_string_ result is equal to the number of sequences of non space characters in the type_string_ param_s_.
- The order of the sequences of non space characters in the type_string_ result is the reverse order of the sequences of non space characters in the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_string_ result is equal to strz_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains alphabets digits and space characters.
