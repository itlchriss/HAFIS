(10s elapsed)- The String parameter `s` is expected to contain at least one contiguous sequence of non space characters and its length must lie between one and ten thousand inclusive.  
- The String parameter `s` may include upper case English letters lower case English letters digits and space characters with no other character types permitted.  
- The String result shall present the words that appear in `s` in precisely reverse order joined by exactly one space character.  
- The String result shall exclude any leading or trailing space characters so that its first and last characters are never spaces.  
- The String result shall collapse every series of two or more consecutive space characters that occur in `s` into a single space character used as the separator between adjacent words.
