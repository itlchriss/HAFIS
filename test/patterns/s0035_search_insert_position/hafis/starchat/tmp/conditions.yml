ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 5 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 7 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is unique and is sorted to the ascending_order.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
