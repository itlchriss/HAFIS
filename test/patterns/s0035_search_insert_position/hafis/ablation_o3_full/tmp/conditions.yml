ensures:
- if int the type_string_ strs_a occurs in int[] the type_string_ strs_b then int result equals the index at which int the type_string_ strs_c is found in int[] the type_string_ strs_d.
- if int the type_string_ strs_a does not occur in int[] the type_string_ strs_b then int result equals the index at which int the type_string_ strs_c is inserted into int[] the type_string_ strs_d such that the ascending_order is preserved.
- int result is guaranteed to be in the inclusive range 0 to the length of int[] the type_string_ strs_a.
