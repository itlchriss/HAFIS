(11s elapsed)Below is a self-contained JML specification for a method that realizes the
“Search Insert Position’’ contract.

```java
public class SearchInsertPosition {

    /*@
      public normal_behavior
        // ---------  Pre–conditions  -------------------------------------
        requires nums != null;
        // size constraint
        requires 1 <= nums.length && nums.length <= 10000;

        // value range of every array element
        requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length;
                     -10000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000);

        // array is strictly increasing  (sorted + all values distinct)
        requires (\forall int i, j; 
                     0 <= i && i < j && j < nums.length ==> nums[i] < nums[j]);

        // value range of the target
        requires -10000 <= target && target <= 10000;

        // ---------  Frame condition  ------------------------------------

        ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= nums.length;

        // If target is present, return *its* index
        ensures (\exists int k; 0 <= k && k < nums.length && nums[k] == target)
                   ==> nums[\result] == target;

        /* If target is not present, the returned index is the place where
           it must be inserted to keep the array sorted.                     */
        ensures (\forall int k; 0 <= k && k < nums.length ==> nums[k] != target)
                   ==> ( (\forall int k; 0 <= k && k < \result; nums[k] < target)

            elements that are strictly smaller than the target.              */
        ensures \result ==
                (\num_of int k; 0 <= k && k < nums.length && nums[k] < target; 1);

Explanation of the key clauses

• `requires` clauses encode the constraints given in the original problem:  
  – non-null array, 1 ≤ length ≤ 10 000, sorted, distinct, and bounded values.  
  – target in the same numeric range.

• `assignable \nothing`/`pure` states that the method has no side effects—
  it only reads its parameters and returns a value.

• The three `ensures` groups collectively capture the functional behaviour:
  1. The returned index is always within `0 … nums.length`.
  2. If the target actually occurs, that index is returned.
  3. Otherwise the index is exactly where the target would have to be inserted
     to maintain the strictly increasing order; equivalently it equals the
     number of elements smaller than the target.

This JML specification can be attached to any Java implementation intended to
solve the Search Insert Position problem; a verification tool can then be used
to prove that the implementation satisfies the specification.
