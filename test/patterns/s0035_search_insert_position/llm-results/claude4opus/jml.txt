Here's the JML specification for the Search Insert Position problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 10000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @           -10000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000);
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length - 1; 
      @           nums[i] < nums[i + 1]);
      @ requires -10000 <= target && target <= 10000;
      @ ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= nums.length;
      @ ensures (\result < nums.length) ==> 
      @         (nums[\result] == target || 
      @          ((\result == 0 || nums[\result - 1] < target) && 
      @           target < nums[\result]));
      @ ensures (\result == nums.length) ==> 
      @         (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] < target);
      @ ensures (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] == target) ==>
      @         nums[\result] == target;
      @ ensures !(\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] == target) ==>
      @         ((\result == 0 || nums[\result - 1] < target) && 
      @          (\result == nums.length || target < nums[\result]));
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        // Implementation with O(log n) complexity (binary search)
        return 0; // placeholder
    }
}
```

Key aspects of this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums` is not null
   - Array length is between 1 and 10,000
   - All elements are within the range [-10,000, 10,000]
   - Array is sorted in strictly ascending order (distinct values)
   - Target is within the valid range

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - Result is a valid index (0 to nums.length inclusive)
   - If result is within array bounds:
     - Either we found the target at that position, OR
     - The target should be inserted at that position (greater than previous element if exists, less than current element)
   - If result equals array length, target is greater than all elements
   - If target exists in array, result points to it
   - If target doesn't exist, result is the correct insertion position

3. **Additional notes:**
   - The method is marked as `pure` since it doesn't modify any state
   - The specification captures the binary search invariant implicitly through the postconditions
   - The O(log n) complexity requirement is documented but not formally verified in JML (this would typically be done through loop invariants in the implementation)
