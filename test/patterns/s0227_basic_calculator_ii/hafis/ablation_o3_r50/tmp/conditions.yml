ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 7.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strl_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ contains a division operator , each division operation contributing to the type_integer_ result uses truncation toward the 0 literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s values are either space characters digits from 0 to 9 the + sign character the - sign character the asterisk character or the forward slash character.
- All integer literals contained in the type_string_ param_s_ are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- The type_string_ param_s_ is equal to syntactically valid arithmetic expression formed from non_negative_integers the operators + - asterisk and forward slash and optional spaces.
