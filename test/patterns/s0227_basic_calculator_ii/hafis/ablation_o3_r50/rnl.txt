(12s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 300000.  
- All characters in the string parameter `s` are either space characters digits from 0 to 9 the plus sign character the minus sign character the asterisk character or the forward slash character.  
- All integer literals contained in the string parameter `s` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- The string parameter `s` represents a syntactically valid arithmetic expression formed from non-negative integers the operators plus minus asterisk and forward slash and optional spaces.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -2147483648 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "3+2*2", the integer result is equal to 7.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to " 3/2 ", the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to " 3+5 / 2 ", the integer result is equal to 5.  
- If the string parameter `s` contains a division operator, each division operation contributing to the integer result uses truncation toward the zero literal.
