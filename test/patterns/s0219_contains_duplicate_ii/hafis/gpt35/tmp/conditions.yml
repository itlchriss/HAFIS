ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exist 2 unique indices the type_character_ chrs_a and the type_character_ chrs_b in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ such that the values at these indices are equal and the absolute difference between the type_character_ chrs_c and the type_character_ chrs_d is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there exist no 2 unique indices the type_character_ chrs_a and the type_character_ chrs_b in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ such that the values at these indices are equal and the absolute difference between the type_character_ chrs_c and the type_character_ chrs_d is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_k_.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
