ensures:
- The type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal if there exist 2 unique indices i and j in the param_stry_a_ of type int[] such that the values at those indices are equal and the absolute difference between i and j is less_than_or_equal to the param_stry_b_ of type int.
- The type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal when no pair of unique indices in the param_stry_a_ of type int[] satisfies both value equality and the distance constraint defined by the param_stry_b_ of type int.
requires:
- Each element in the param_stry_a_ of type int[] is an integer in the inclusive range - 1 1000000000 to 1 1000000000.
- The param_stry_a_ of type int is an integer between 0 and 100000 inclusive.
