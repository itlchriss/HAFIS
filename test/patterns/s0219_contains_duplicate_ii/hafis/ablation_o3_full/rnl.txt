(11s elapsed)- The parameter "nums" of type int[] must have length between 1 and 100000 inclusive  
- Each element in the parameter "nums" of type int[] must be an integer in the inclusive range minus one billion to one billion  
- The parameter "k" of type int must be an integer between 0 and 100000 inclusive  
- The boolean result is true if and only if there exist two distinct indices i and j in the parameter "nums" of type int[] such that the values at those indices are equal and the absolute difference between i and j is less than or equal to the parameter "k" of type int  
- The boolean result is false when no pair of distinct indices in the parameter "nums" of type int[] satisfies both value equality and the distance constraint defined by the parameter "k" of type int
