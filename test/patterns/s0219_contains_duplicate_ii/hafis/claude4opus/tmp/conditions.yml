ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exist 2 unique indices in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ that the values at those indices are equal and the absolute difference between the indices is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there do not exist 2 unique indices in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ that the values at those indices are equal and the absolute difference between the indices is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 3 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 2 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
