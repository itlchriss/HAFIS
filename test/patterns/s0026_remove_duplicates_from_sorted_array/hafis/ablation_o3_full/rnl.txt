(8s elapsed)- int[] `nums` is expected to be sorted in non-decreasing order before the method is invoked  
- the length of int[] `nums` is expected to be between 0 and 30000 inclusive before the method is invoked  
- each element of int[] `nums` is expected to be within the range â€“100 to 100 inclusive before the method is invoked  
- if int[] `nums` has length 0 before invocation then result int equals 0 and int[] `nums` remains unchanged after execution  
- int result equals the number of distinct elements remaining in int[] `nums` after duplicates have been removed in place  
- after execution the first result int elements of int[] `nums` each appear exactly once and their original relative order is preserved  
- after execution any element of int[] `nums` located at an index greater than or equal to result int is left unspecified
