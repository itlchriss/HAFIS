ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 30000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 100.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is sorted to the ascending_order.
