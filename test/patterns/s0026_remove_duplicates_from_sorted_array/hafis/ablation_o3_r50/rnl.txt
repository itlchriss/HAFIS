(18s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 30000.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -100 and are less than or equal to 100.  
- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in non decreasing order.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- All the values whose indices are lower than the integer result in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique.  
- The order of the values whose indices are lower than the integer result in the integer array parameter `nums` is unchanged from their original order before the method call.  
- If all the values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique, the integer result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,1,2], the integer result is equal to 2 and the value at index 0 in the integer array parameter `nums` is 1 and the value at index 1 in the integer array parameter `nums` is 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4], the integer result is equal to 5 and the sequence 0 1 2 3 4 occupies indices 0 to 4 in the integer array parameter `nums`.
