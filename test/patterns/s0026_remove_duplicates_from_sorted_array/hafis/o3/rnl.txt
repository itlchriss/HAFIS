(19s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 30000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -100 and are less than or equal to 100.  
- The integer array parameter `nums` is sorted in ascending order.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- All values at indices ranging from 0 up to the integer result minus 1 in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique.  
- For every index i such that i is greater than 0 and is less than the integer result, the value at index i in the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than the value at index i minus 1 in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,1,2], the integer result is equal to 2 and the value at index 0 in the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 1 and the value at index 1 in the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4], the integer result is equal to 5 and the values at indices 0 1 2 3 and 4 in the integer array parameter `nums` are equal to 0 1 2 3 and 4 respectively.
