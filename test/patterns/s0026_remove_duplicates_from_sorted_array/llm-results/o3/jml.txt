The specification is written so that any Java implementation that satisfies it will exhibit exactly the externally visible behaviour requested in the informal problem statement.

      requires nums != null;

      requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i + 1 < nums.length;

Explanations of the most important clauses

1.  The `requires` clauses encode the two assumptions the algorithm is allowed to make: the array reference is not `null`, and the input is sorted.

2.  Clause A ensures there are no duplicates in the meaningful prefix of the array that the method returns (`k == \result`).

3.  Clause B establishes that every value occurring in the original array appears exactly once in that prefix, and nothing else appears there.

4.  Clause C formalises “relative order is kept”: for any two indices `i < j` in the prefix produced by the algorithm, the position where `nums[i]` originally occurred is to the left of the position where `nums[j]` originally occurred.

5.  The `assignable` clause states that the method may modify any cell of `nums` but nothing else, thereby capturing the “in-place, O(1) extra memory” requirement from the informal statement.

Any implementation of `removeDuplicates` that fulfils this JML contract automatically satisfies the complete informal specification given in the problem description.
