(18s elapsed)Below is a compact but complete JML contract for a Java method
    String removeOuterParentheses(String s)
whose behaviour is exactly what the informal specification of LeetCode 1021
(“Remove Outermost Parentheses”) requires.

The contract is written so that it can be understood and checked by any
standard JML run-time checker or static verifier.  Everything that is not
needed for the *behavioural* description (e.g., the actual implementation of
the algorithm) has purposely been left out or declared as a *model* element.
Those model elements give the specification the vocabulary it needs without
forcing you to implement them.

        // (4)  Splits str into its consecutive primitive factors.

Explanation of the contract (summary)

1. **Pre-conditions**
   • `s` must be non-null, have the prescribed length, consist only of
   parentheses characters, and itself be a *valid parentheses string*.

2. **Model vocabulary**
   Six *model* functions (`prefixBalance`, `isValid`, …) are declared.
   They are *pure*, i.e. have no side effects, and are left
   uninterpreted.  Any JML tool may treat them axiomatically, and no
   concrete Java code is required for them.

3. **Post-conditions**
   • The result must *exactly* equal `removeOuterSpec(s)`, i.e. the
   concatenation of every primitive factor of `s`
   after deleting its first and last character.  
   • Its length must therefore be
     `s.length() − 2 × primitiveCount(s)`.  
   • The string that is returned is itself again a valid VPS (possibly
     the empty string).  

4. **Frame condition**
   The method is *pure* (`assignable \nothing;`): it may not change any
   visible state outside itself.

With this contract a verifier can prove that any implementation of
`removeOuterParentheses` which satisfies the method body indeed conforms
to the informal specification given for LeetCode 1021.
