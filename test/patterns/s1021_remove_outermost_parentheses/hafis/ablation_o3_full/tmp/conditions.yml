ensures:
- The result String result is obtained by removing the outermost pair of parentheses from every primitive substring in the param_String_ the type_character_ chrs_a and concatenating their remaining characters in the original sequence.
- The length of the result String result equals the length of the param_String_ the type_character_ chrs_a - twice the number of primitive substrings contained in the param_String_ the type_character_ chrs_b.
requires:
- The param_String_ the type_character_ chrs_a must contain exclusively the 2 characters that represent an opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis.
- The param_String_ the type_character_ chrs_a is equal to valid parentheses string as defined in the overall specification.
