(9s elapsed)- The parameter String `s` must have a length within the inclusive range from 1 to 100000.  
- The parameter String `s` must contain exclusively the two characters that represent an opening parenthesis and a closing parenthesis.  
- The parameter String `s` must be a valid parentheses string as defined in the overall specification.  
- The result String result is obtained by removing the outermost pair of parentheses from every primitive substring in the parameter String `s` and concatenating their remaining characters in the original sequence.  
- The length of the result String result equals the length of the parameter String `s` minus twice the number of primitive substrings contained in the parameter String `s`.
