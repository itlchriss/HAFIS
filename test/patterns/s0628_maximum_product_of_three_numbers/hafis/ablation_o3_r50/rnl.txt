(12s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000 and are greater than or equal to -1000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to the product of any three distinct values in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- There exist three indices of the integer array parameter `nums` such that the product of the three corresponding values is equal to the integer result.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3], the integer result is equal to 6.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,4], the integer result is equal to 24.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [-1,-2,-3], the integer result is equal to -6.
