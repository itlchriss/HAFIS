ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to the product of any 3 unique values in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- There exist 3 indices of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ such that the product of the 3 corresponding values is equal to the integer result.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 24.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 6.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000.
