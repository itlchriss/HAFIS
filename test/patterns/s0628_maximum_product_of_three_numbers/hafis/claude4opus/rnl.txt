Based on the given software specification and following the pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -1000 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -1000000000 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3], the integer result is equal to 6.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,4], the integer result is equal to 24.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [-1,-2,-3], the integer result is equal to -6.
