Looking at this problem, I need to find the maximum product of three numbers from an array. The key insight is that the maximum product can come from either:
1. The three largest numbers (all positive or one negative with two largest positives)
2. The two smallest numbers (if negative) and the largest number (to get a positive product)

Here's the JML specification:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 3;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @           -1000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 1000);
      @ ensures \result == maximumProductOfThree(nums);
      @ ensures (\exists int i, j, k; 
      @           0 <= i && i < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= j && j < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= k && k < nums.length && 
      @           i != j && i != k && j != k &&
      @           \result == nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]);
      @ ensures (\forall int i, j, k; 
      @           0 <= i && i < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= j && j < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= k && k < nums.length && 
      @           i != j && i != k && j != k;
      @           \result >= nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]);
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int maximumProduct(int[] nums) {
        // Implementation
    }
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null && nums.length >= 3;
      @ ensures \result == (\max int i, j, k; 
      @           0 <= i && i < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= j && j < nums.length && 
      @           0 <= k && k < nums.length && 
      @           i != j && i != k && j != k;
      @           nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]);
      @*/
    public /*@ pure helper @*/ int maximumProductOfThree(int[] nums) {
        // This is a specification-only helper method
    }
}
```

Key aspects of this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - Array must not be null
   - Array must have at least 3 elements
   - All elements must be within the range [-1000, 1000]

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - The result equals the maximum product of any three distinct numbers
   - There exist three distinct indices whose product equals the result
   - The result is greater than or equal to any other product of three distinct numbers

3. **Helper method:** I've included a specification-only helper method `maximumProductOfThree` to make the specification clearer. This method formally defines what we mean by the maximum product of three numbers.

4. **Pure methods:** Both methods are marked as `pure` since they don't modify any state.

The specification captures that we need to find three distinct numbers (at different indices) whose product is maximum among all possible combinations of three distinct numbers from the array.
