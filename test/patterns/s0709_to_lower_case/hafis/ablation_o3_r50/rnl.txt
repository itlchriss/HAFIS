(15s elapsed)- The length of the String parameter `s` is less than or equal to 100 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The String parameter `s` consists of printable ASCII characters.  
- The String result has the same length as the String parameter `s`.  
- Each character in the String result is equal to the corresponding character in the String parameter `s` after converting any uppercase English letter to its lowercase form.  
- If the String parameter `s` is equal to "Hello", the String result is equal to "hello".  
- If the String parameter `s` is equal to "here", the String result is equal to "here".  
- If the String parameter `s` is equal to "LOVELY", the String result is equal to "lovely".
