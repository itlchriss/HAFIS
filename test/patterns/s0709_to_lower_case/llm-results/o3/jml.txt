To Lower Case” problem statement.

```java
/**
 * Returns the string obtained from {@code s} by replacing every
 * upper-case ASCII letter (‘A’–‘Z’) with its lower-case counterpart.
 */
/*@ public normal_behavior
  @
  @   // -------- Preconditions --------

  @   requires 1 <= s.length() && s.length() <= 100;      // size constraint
  @   // printable ASCII: 32 (space) … 126 ('~')
  @   requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < s.length();
  @                32 <= s.charAt(i) && s.charAt(i) <= 126);
  @
  @   // -------- Postconditions --------

Explanation of the clauses

• `requires` clauses encode the Constraints section:  
  – non-null input;  
  – 1 ≤ length ≤ 100;  
  – every character lies in the printable ASCII interval 32–126.

• `ensures` clauses capture the behavioural part of the description:  
  – the result’s length equals the input’s length;  
  – for every index `i`, the result character is either the same character
    (if it is not an uppercase ASCII letter) or its lowercase counterpart.

• `assignable \nothing` marks the method as side-effect free; the `pure`
  modifier is added for clarity.
