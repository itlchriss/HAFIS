(11s elapsed)Thinking... (11s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `numbers` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 2.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `numbers` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.  
- The integer parameter `target` is less than or equal to 1000000000 and is greater than or equal to -1000000000.  
- The length of the integer array result is equal to 2.  
- The integer value at index 0 of the integer array result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the length of the integer array parameter `numbers`.  
- The integer value at index 1 of the integer array result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than the length of the integer array parameter `numbers`.  
- The integer value at index 0 of the integer array result is not equal to the integer value at index 1 of the integer array result.  
- The sum between the integer array parameter `numbers` value at the index equal to the integer value at index 0 of the integer array result and the integer array parameter `numbers` value at the index equal to the integer value at index 1 of the integer array result is equal to the integer parameter `target`.  
- If the integer array parameter `numbers` is equal to [2,7,11,15] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 9, the integer array result is equal to [0,1].  
- If the integer array parameter `numbers` is equal to [3,2,4] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 6, the integer array result is equal to [1,2].  
- If the integer array parameter `numbers` is equal to [3,3] and the integer parameter `target` is equal to 6, the integer array result is equal to [0,1].
