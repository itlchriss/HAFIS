ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ result's first_element is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length.
- The second value in the type_integer_array_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ result's first_element is not_equal to the second value in the type_integer_array_ result .
- The sum of the value at index equal to the type_integer_array_ result's type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s first_element and the value at index equal to the second value in the type_integer_array_ result in the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to the type_integer_ param_target_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_array_ result contains 0 and 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result contains 1 and 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result contains 0 and 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 2 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
