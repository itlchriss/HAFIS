ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ result's first_element is not_equal to the second value of the type_integer_array_ result .
- Both values in the type_integer_array_ result are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s length.
- The sum between the value at the index equal to the type_integer_array_ result's type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s first_element and the value at the index equal to the second value of the type_integer_array_ result of the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to the type_integer_ param_target_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_target_ is equal to 6 , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_numbers_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
- The type_integer_ param_target_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
- Exactly 1 pair of unique indices exists in the type_integer_array_ param_numbers_ whose corresponding values sum to the type_integer_ param_target_.
