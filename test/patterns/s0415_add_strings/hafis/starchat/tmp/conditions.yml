ensures:
- The type_string_ result is equal to non-negative integer represented by a string.
- The type_string_ result is the sum of the non_negative_integers represented by the type_string_ param_num1_ and param_num2_.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_num1_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_num2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_num1_ only contains digits.
- The type_string_ param_num2_ only contains digits.
- The type_string_ param_num1_ and param_num2_ don't have any leading zeros except for the 0 itself.
