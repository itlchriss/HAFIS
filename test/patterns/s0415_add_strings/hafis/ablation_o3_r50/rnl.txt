(10s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `num1` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the string parameter `num2` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `num1` contains only digit characters.  
- The string parameter `num2` contains only digit characters.  
- If the string parameter `num1` is not equal to the string literal "0", the first character of the string parameter `num1` is not equal to the character '0'.  
- If the string parameter `num2` is not equal to the string literal "0", the first character of the string parameter `num2` is not equal to the character '0'.  
- The string result contains only digit characters.  
- If the string result is not equal to the string literal "0", the first character of the string result is not equal to the character '0'.  
- The integer value of the string result is equal to the sum between the integer value of the string parameter `num1` and the integer value of the string parameter `num2`.  
- If the string parameter `num1` is equal to "11" and the string parameter `num2` is equal to "123", the string result is equal to "134".  
- If the string parameter `num1` is equal to "456" and the string parameter `num2` is equal to "77", the string result is equal to "533".  
- If the string parameter `num1` is equal to "0" and the string parameter `num2` is equal to "0", the string result is equal to "0".
