ensures:
- The type_string_ result only contains digit characters.
- If the type_string_ result is not_equal to the string literal stry_a , the type_string_ result's first_element is not_equal to the character the chry_a.
- The integer value of the type_string_ result is equal to the sum between the integer value of the type_string_ param_num1_ and the integer value of the type_string_ param_num2_.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_num2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_num2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_num1_ only contains digit characters.
- The type_string_ param_num2_ only contains digit characters.
- If the type_string_ param_num1_ is not_equal to the string literal stry_a , the type_string_ param_num1_'s first_element is not_equal to the character the chry_a.
- If the type_string_ param_num2_ is not_equal to the string literal stry_a , the type_string_ param_num2_'s first_element is not_equal to the character the chry_a.
