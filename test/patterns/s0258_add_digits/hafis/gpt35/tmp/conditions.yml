ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is equal to single_digit.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 38 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
