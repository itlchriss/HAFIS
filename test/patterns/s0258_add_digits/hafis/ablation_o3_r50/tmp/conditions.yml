ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 9.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is less_than_or_equal to 9 , the type_integer_ result is equal to the type_integer_ param_num_.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ mod 9 is not equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to the type_integer_ param_num_ mod 9.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is not equal to 0 and the type_integer_ param_num_ mod 9 is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 9.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 38 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
