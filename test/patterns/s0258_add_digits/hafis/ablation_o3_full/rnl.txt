(9s elapsed)- If int `num` equals 0 then int result equals 0  
- If int `num` has exactly one decimal digit then int result equals `num`  
- If int `num` has more than one decimal digit then int result equals the single digit produced by repeatedly summing the decimal digits of `num` until only one digit remains  
- For every int `num` within 0 to 2147483647 inclusive int result is an int within 0 to 9 inclusive
