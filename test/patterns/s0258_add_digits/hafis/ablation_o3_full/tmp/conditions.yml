ensures:
- If int the type_string_ strs_a has 1 decimal digit then int result equals the type_string_ strs_b.
- If int the type_string_ strs_a has more than 1 decimal digit then int result equals the single_digit produced by repeatedly summing the decimal digits of the type_string_ strs_b until only 1 digit remains.
- For every int the type_string_ strs_a in 0 to 2147483647 inclusive int result is an int in 0 to 9 inclusive.
