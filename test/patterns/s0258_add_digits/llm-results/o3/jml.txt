(7s elapsed)Below is a self-contained Java signature together with a complete JML contract that captures the informal specification of “Add Digits”.

```java
public class AddDigits {

    /*@
      @ public normal_behavior
      @   requires 0 <= num && num <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      @
      @   /*  The result is a single decimal digit. * /
      @   ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 9;
      @
      @   /*  Functional definition (digital root). * /
      @   ensures (num == 0) ==> (\result == 0);
      @   ensures (num != 0) ==> (\result == 1 + (num - 1) % 9);
      @
      @   /*  No visible state is modified. * /
      @   assignable \nothing;
      @
      @   /*  Intended for use as a mathematical (side-effect-free) function. * /
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ static int addDigits(int num);
}
```

Explanation of the clauses

1. `requires`  
   Constrains the admissible inputs to the range given in the original problem statement.

2. `ensures` (first)  
   States that the returned value is a single decimal digit.

3. `ensures` (second & third)  
   Provide an explicit mathematical description of the result—  
   the well-known closed-form digital-root formula that runs in O(1) time and uses no loops or recursion.

4. `assignable \\nothing`  
   Guarantees that the method does not modify any memory location that is visible to callers.

5. `/*@ pure @*/`  
   Declares the method side-effect-free so it can be used in other JML annotations as a mathematical function.
