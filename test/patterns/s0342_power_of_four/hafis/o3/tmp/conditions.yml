ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 and there exists an integer value x is greater_than_or_equal to 0 such that the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 4 to the power of x.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 0 or for every integer value x is greater_than_or_equal to 0 the type_integer_ param_n_ is not equal to 4 to the power of x.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 5 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
