- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0 and there exists an integer value x greater than or equal to 0 such that the integer parameter `n` is equal to 4 to the power of x.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 0 or for every integer value x greater than or equal to 0 the integer parameter `n` is not equal to 4 to the power of x.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 16, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 5, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
