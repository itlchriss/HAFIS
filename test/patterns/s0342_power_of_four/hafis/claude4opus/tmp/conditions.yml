ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an integer x such that the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 4 raised to the power of x.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there does not exist an integer x such that the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 4 raised to the power of x.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 5 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
