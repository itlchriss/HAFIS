- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, there exists an integer x greater than or equal to 0 such that 4 raised to x is equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, for all integers x greater than or equal to 0 the value 4 raised to x is not equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 16, boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 5, boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, boolean result is equal to the true literal.
