ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
requires:

- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s values are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s values are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ are contained by the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
