ensures:
- For every valid index i of int array the type_string_ strs_a the element at i in result int array equals the first int value located to the right of the matching value in int array the type_string_ strs_b that is strictly is greater_than to the value at i in int array the type_string_ strs_c when such a value exists.
- For every valid index i of int array the type_string_ strs_a if no int value strictly is greater_than to the value at i in int array the type_string_ strs_b appears to the right of its matching position in int array the type_string_ strs_c then the element at i in result int array equals negative 1.
