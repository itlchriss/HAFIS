For each index i in the bounds of the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ if no value is greater_than to the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ occurs to the right of the matching value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to negative 1 .
