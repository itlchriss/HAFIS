For each index i in the bounds of the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ if a value is greater_than to the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ occurs to the right of the matching value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the first such greater value found in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ .
