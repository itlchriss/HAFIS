ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length.
- For each index i in the bounds of the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ if a value is greater_than to the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ occurs to the right of the matching value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the first such greater value found in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
- For each index i in the bounds of the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ if no value is greater_than to the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ occurs to the right of the matching value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ the value at index i in the type_integer_array_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length.
- All values in the type_integer_array_ parameters the type_string_ strs_aand the type_string_ strs_b are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- All values in the type_integer_array_ parameters the type_string_ strs_aand the type_string_ strs_b are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ are contained by the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
