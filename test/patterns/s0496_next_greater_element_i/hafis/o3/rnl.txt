(21s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums2`.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is less than or equal to 1000 and is greater than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums1`.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are unique.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are unique.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are contained in the integer array parameter `nums2`.  
- The length of the integer array result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums1`.  
- For every index i, if the integer array result at index i is equal to -1, there is no value in the integer array parameter `nums2` that is greater than the integer array parameter `nums1` at index i and appears to the right of that value in the integer array parameter `nums2`.  
- For every index i, if the integer array result at index i is not equal to -1, the integer array result at index i is the first value in the integer array parameter `nums2` that is greater than the integer array parameter `nums1` at index i and appears to the right of that value in the integer array parameter `nums2`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [4,1,2] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [1,3,4,2], the integer array result is equal to [-1,3,-1].  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [2,4] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [1,2,3,4], the integer array result is equal to [3,-1].
