ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length.
- For every index i , if the type_integer_array_ result at index i is equal to negative 1 , there exists no value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ that is greater_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ at index i and appears to the right of that value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
- For every index i , if the type_integer_array_ result at index i is not equal to negative 1 , the type_integer_array_ result at index i is the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s first_element that is greater_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ at index i and appears to the right of that value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s values are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s values are unique.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s values are contained in the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_.
