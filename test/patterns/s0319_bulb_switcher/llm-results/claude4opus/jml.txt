Looking at this problem, I need to understand the pattern of bulb switching and convert it to JML (Java Modeling Language) specification.

Let me analyze the problem:
- Initially all n bulbs are off
- Round 1: Turn on all bulbs (toggle every 1st bulb)
- Round 2: Toggle every 2nd bulb
- Round 3: Toggle every 3rd bulb
- ...
- Round i: Toggle every i-th bulb
- Round n: Toggle every n-th bulb (only the last one)

A bulb at position k gets toggled in round i if k is divisible by i. So bulb k gets toggled once for each divisor of k. Since bulbs start off, a bulb will be on at the end if it has an odd number of divisors.

Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. Therefore, the answer is the number of perfect squares ≤ n, which is floor(√n).

Here's the JML specification:

```java
public class BulbSwitcher {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires n >= 0;
      @ ensures \result == (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n));
      @ ensures \result >= 0;
      @ ensures \result * \result <= n;
      @ ensures (\result + 1) * (\result + 1) > n;
      @*/
    /*@ pure @*/
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires n >= 0 && n <= 1000000000;
      @ ensures n == 0 ==> \result == 0;
      @ ensures n == 1 ==> \result == 1;
      @ ensures n == 3 ==> \result == 1;
      @ ensures n == 4 ==> \result == 2;
      @ ensures n == 9 ==> \result == 3;
      @ ensures \result == countPerfectSquares(n);
      @*/
    /*@ pure @*/
    public int bulbSwitchAlternative(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
    
    /*@ private normal_behavior
      @ requires n >= 0;
      @ ensures \result == (\num_of int i; 1 <= i && i <= n; i * i == i * i && i * i <= n);
      @*/
    /*@ pure helper @*/
    private int countPerfectSquares(int n) {
        return (int) Math.sqrt(n);
    }
}
```

The key JML specifications include:
1. **Precondition**: `requires n >= 0` - n must be non-negative
2. **Postcondition**: `ensures \result == (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(n))` - the result equals the floor of square root of n
3. **Additional postconditions**: 
   - The result is non-negative
   - `\result * \result <= n` - the square of result doesn't exceed n
   - `(\result + 1) * (\result + 1) > n` - the next perfect square exceeds n
4. **Specific test cases**: Verified the examples given (n=0→0, n=1→1, n=3→1)
5. **Pure method**: Marked as `pure` since it has no side effects

The specification captures that we're counting perfect squares up to n, which is mathematically equivalent to finding floor(√n).
