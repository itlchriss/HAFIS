(13s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- The integer result is equal to the number of bulbs that remain on after the toggling process described for the integer parameter `n` rounds.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 3, the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 1.
