ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the number of bulbs that remain on after the toggling process described for the type_integer_ param_n_ rounds.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
