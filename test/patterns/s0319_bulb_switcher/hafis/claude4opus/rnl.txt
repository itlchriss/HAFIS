Based on the given software specification and following the established pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the integer parameter `n`.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 1.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 3, the integer result is equal to 1.
