ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 10 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 100 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 10.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 10000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 316.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 100000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31625.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 316227.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 10000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3162277.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 100000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31622776.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1000000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 316227766.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
