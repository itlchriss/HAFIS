ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- The product between the type_integer_ result and the type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_ and the product between the type_integer_ result + 1 and the type_integer_ result + 1 is greater_than to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
