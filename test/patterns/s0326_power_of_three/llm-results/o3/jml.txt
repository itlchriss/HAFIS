(16s elapsed)Below is a self-contained JML contract that captures exactly the informal specification you supplied.  
It can be pasted in front of a corresponding Java method implementation.

```java
/*@
  @   /* 326. Power of Three
  @    * Returns true  ⇔  n is an exact integer power of 3.
  @    * ---------------------------------------------------
  @    *  -2^31 ≤ n ≤ 2^31–1  is already guaranteed by Java’s
  @    *    ‘int’ type, but it is written explicitly to stay
  @    *    close to the original statement of the problem.
  @    *  - The method is pure (side-effect free).
  @    *  - A number is a power of three iff
  @    *      ∃ x ≥ 0 : n == 3^x .
  @    */
  @
  @   // PRECONDITION  (redundant but mirrors the task text)
  @   requires Integer.MIN_VALUE <= n && n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
  @
  @   // FRAME CONDITION: no state may be modified
  @   assignable \nothing;
  @
  @   // POSTCONDITION: result is true exactly when n is a power of 3
  @   ensures \result <==>
  @           ( \exists int x;  x >= 0;  n == \pow(3, x) );
  @*/
public /*@ pure @*/ static boolean isPowerOfThree(int n);
```

Explanation of the central pieces:

1. `assignable \nothing;` — expresses that the method has no side effects.
2. `\pow(3, x)` — the mathematical power operator provided by JML (uses unbounded‐precision arithmetic, so no overflow problems in the specification).
3. `(\exists int x; x >= 0; n == \pow(3, x))` — formalizes “there exists an integer x ≥ 0 such that n == 3^x”.
4. The bidirectional implication `\result <==>` guarantees both directions:
   • If the method returns true, `n` really is a power of 3.  
   • If `n` is a power of 3, the method must return true.
