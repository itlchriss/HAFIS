To convert the given problem statement into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants that describe the behavior of the method. Here's how you can express the problem in JML:

```java
public class PowerOfThree {

    /*@ 
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires Integer.MIN_VALUE <= n && n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
      @ ensures \result == (\exists int x; Integer.MIN_VALUE <= x && x <= Integer.MAX_VALUE; n == Math.pow(3, x));
      @*/
    public static boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Precondition (`requires`)**: The input `n` must be within the range of a 32-bit signed integer, which is already guaranteed by the method signature since `n` is of type `int`.

- **Postcondition (`ensures`)**: The method returns `true` if there exists an integer `x` such that `n` is equal to `3` raised to the power of `x`. This is expressed using the JML existential quantifier `\exists`.

- **Method Signature**: The method `isPowerOfThree` takes an integer `n` and returns a boolean indicating whether `n` is a power of three.

This JML specification describes the expected behavior of the method without detailing the implementation, which is consistent with the problem statement's requirements.
