- If the integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 0, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, there exists an integer x such that the integer parameter `n` is equal to 3 raised to the power of x and the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer parameter `n` is not equal to any integer power of 3.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 27, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 9, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
