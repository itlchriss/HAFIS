ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an integer x such that the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 raised to the power of x and the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is not equal to any integer power of 3.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 27 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 9 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
