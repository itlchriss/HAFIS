(8s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 2147483647 and is greater than or equal to -2147483648.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 27, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 9, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, there exists an integer exponent such that 3 raised to that exponent is equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, there does not exist an integer exponent such that 3 raised to that exponent is equal to the integer parameter `n`.
