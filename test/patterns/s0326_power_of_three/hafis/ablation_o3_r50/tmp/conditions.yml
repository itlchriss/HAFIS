ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 27 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 9 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an integer exponent such that 3 raised to that exponent is equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there does not exist an integer exponent such that 3 raised to that exponent is equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
