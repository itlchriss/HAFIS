Based on the given software specification and following the pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums` minus 1.
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 0.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,3,1,1,4], the integer result is equal to 2.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,3,0,1,4], the integer result is equal to 2.
