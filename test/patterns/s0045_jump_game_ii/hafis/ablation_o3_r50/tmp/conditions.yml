ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the minimum count of jumps required to move from index 0 to the difference between the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length and 1 when each jump length is less_than_or_equal to the value at the starting index of that jump in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000.
