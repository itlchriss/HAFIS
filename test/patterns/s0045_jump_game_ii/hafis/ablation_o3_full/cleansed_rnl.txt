- Requires length of 'nums' is at least 1 and at most 10000
- Requires every element of int[] 'nums' is between 0 and 1000 inclusive
- Ensures int result equals 0 when length of 'nums' is exactly 1
- Ensures int result is a positive integer strictly less than length of 'nums' when length of 'nums' is greater than 1
- Ensures starting at index zero and obeying the maximum jump lengths given by int[] 'nums' the last index is reachable in exactly result jumps
- Ensures there exists no valid sequence of jumps from index zero to the last index that uses fewer jumps than int result
