ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length - 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- For every integer value y that is less_than to the type_integer_ result , reaching the last index of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ from index 0 in y jumps with each jump length is less_than_or_equal to the value at the current position of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is impossible.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000.
