- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums` minus 1.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- For every integer value y that is less than the integer result, reaching the last index of the integer array parameter `nums` from index 0 in y jumps with each jump length less than or equal to the value at the current position of the integer array parameter `nums` is impossible.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,3,1,1,4], the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,3,0,1,4], the integer result is equal to 2.
