The given Python code implements a solution to find the minimum number of jumps required to reach the end of an array with non-negative integer values representing maximum jump lengths at each position. This problem falls under the category of dynamic programming. My solution uses a greedy approach by iterating through the input list while keeping track of the farthest reachable point (`maxReach`) and the current jump limit (`steps`). As I traverse the array, whenever my current position equals the current jump limit, it means I've completed one jump, so I increment the count of jumps and update the new jump limit using the value stored in `maxReach`. Finally, after processing all elements except the last one, I return the total number of jumps taken to reach the end of the array.

Now let's analyze how this algorithm works using the provided examples:

1. For the input `[2, 3, 1, 1, 4]`:
   - Initially, `maxReach` and `steps` both equal 2 (from the first index).
   - After traversing the second index, `maxReach` becomes 4 (maximum between previous `maxReach` and `2+1`), but since `steps` remains 2, no additional jump occurs yet.
   - Moving on to the third index, `maxReach` updates again to 5 (maximum between previous `maxReach` and `3+1`). Now, as `steps` has been exhausted (reached its limit), we increment `jumps` to 2 and set `steps` to `maxReach`, which now equals 5.
   - We continue this process until reaching the fourth index where `maxReach` stays the same (5) because there's only one more element left. Since `steps` also equals 5, another jump is made, increasing `jumps` to 3.
   - At the final index, we don't need any further jumps because we're already at the destination. So, the output is 2.

2. Similarly, for the input `[2, 3, 0, 1, 4]` with expected output 2:
   - Again, starting from the first index, `maxReach` and `steps` both equal 2.
   - Upon visiting the second index, `maxReach` becomes 5. With `steps` still being 2, no jump happens.
   - When moving to the third index, `nums[i]` is 0, indicating no possible jump from here. However, since we know we can always reach the end, we simply ignore this zero and move forward.
   - Visiting the fourth index, `maxReach` increases to 6. Now, `steps` reaches its limit, causing us to make a jump and updating `jumps` to 2 alongside setting `steps` back to `maxReach`, which equals 6.
   - Reaching the last index without needing any extra jumps confirms that the output should be 2.

This implementation adheres to the constraints specified in the problem statement, ensuring optimal performance even for large arrays up to size 10^4.
