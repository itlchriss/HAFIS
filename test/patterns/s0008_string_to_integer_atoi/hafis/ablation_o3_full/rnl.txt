- If every character in String `str` is the space character then int result equals 0  
- All leading space characters in String `str` are ignored when determining int result  
- If the first non space character of String `str` is the character '+' and at least one decimal digit follows then int result equals the numeric value represented by the consecutive decimal digits that immediately follow the character '+' subject to clamping to the range -2147483648 to 2147483647  
- If the first non space character of String `str` is the character '-' and at least one decimal digit follows then int result equals the negated numeric value represented by the consecutive decimal digits that immediately follow the character '-' subject to clamping to the range -2147483648 to 2147483647  
- If the first non space character of String `str` is a decimal digit then int result equals the numeric value represented by the consecutive decimal digits starting at that position subject to clamping to the range -2147483648 to 2147483647  
- If no decimal digit exists after processing optional leading spaces and optional sign indicator in String `str` then int result equals 0  
- If the computed numeric value before clamping exceeds 2147483647 then int result equals 2147483647  
- If the computed numeric value before clamping is less than -2147483648 then int result equals -2147483648
