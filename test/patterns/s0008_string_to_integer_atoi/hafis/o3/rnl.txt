(8s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `str` is less than or equal to 200 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- All characters in the string parameter `str` are either English letters or digits or the space character or the plus sign or the minus sign or the dot character.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to 2147483647 and is greater than or equal to -2147483648.  
- If the numeric value obtained from the first contiguous digit sequence after ignoring leading spaces and optional sign is greater than 2147483647, the integer result is equal to 2147483647.  
- If the numeric value obtained from the first contiguous digit sequence after ignoring leading spaces and optional sign is less than -2147483648, the integer result is equal to -2147483648.  
- If the string parameter `str` contains no digits after ignoring leading spaces and an optional sign, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `str` is equal to "42", the integer result is equal to 42.  
- If the string parameter `str` is equal to " -42", the integer result is equal to -42.  
- If the string parameter `str` is equal to "4193 with words", the integer result is equal to 4193.  
- If the string parameter `str` is equal to "words and 987", the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `str` is equal to "-91283472332", the integer result is equal to -2147483648.
