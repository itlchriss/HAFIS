(14s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 4 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- Exactly one value in the integer array parameter `nums` appears exactly the quotient between the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and 2 times and all other values in the integer array parameter `nums` appear exactly 1 time.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- The integer result is a value contained in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- The integer result appears exactly the quotient between the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and 2 times in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,3], the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,1,2,5,3,2], the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4], the integer result is equal to 5.
