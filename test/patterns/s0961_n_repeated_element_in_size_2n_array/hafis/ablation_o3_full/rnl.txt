(13s elapsed)- The int array parameter `nums` has length equal to 2 * n where n is an integer between 2 and 5000 inclusive  
- Every value in int array parameter `nums` lies between 0 and 10000 inclusive  
- The int array parameter `nums` contains n plus 1 unique elements and exactly one element that is repeated n times  
- The int result equals the element that is repeated n times in parameter `nums`  
- The int result is contained within parameter `nums`
