ensures:
- The type_integer_ result appears half of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length times in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 4 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is even.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_ contains half of its length_plus1 unique elements.
