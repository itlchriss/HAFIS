Here's the JML specification for the given problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 2 && nums.length % 2 == 0;
      @ requires nums.length == 2 * (nums.length / 2);
      @ requires 2 <= nums.length / 2 && nums.length / 2 <= 5000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @           0 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000);
      @ requires (\exists int repeated; 0 <= repeated && repeated <= 10000;
      @           (\num_of int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] == repeated) 
      @           == nums.length / 2);
      @ requires (\num_of int v; 0 <= v && v <= 10000;
      @           (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] == v))
      @           == (nums.length / 2) + 1;
      @ ensures (\num_of int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i] == \result) 
      @         == nums.length / 2;
      @ ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 10000;
      @ pure
      @*/
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] nums) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Key points in this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums` is not null
   - Array length is even and at least 2
   - Array length equals 2*n where n is between 2 and 5000
   - All elements are in range [0, 10^4]
   - There exists exactly one element that appears n times (where n = nums.length/2)
   - There are exactly n+1 unique elements in the array

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - The returned value appears exactly n times in the array
   - The returned value is within the valid range [0, 10^4]

3. **Method properties:**
   - Marked as `pure` since it doesn't modify any state
   - Uses `normal_behavior` since the method should not throw exceptions given valid input

The `\num_of` quantifier counts the number of elements satisfying a condition, which is perfect for expressing the constraint about element frequencies in this problem.
