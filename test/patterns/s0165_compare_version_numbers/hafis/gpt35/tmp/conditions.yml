ensures:
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1 , version1 is less_than to version2.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 0 , version1 is equal to version2.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 1 , version1 is greater_than to version2.
- If the type_string_ param_version1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_version2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_version1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_version2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_version1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_version2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_version1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_version2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_string_ param_version1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_version2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
