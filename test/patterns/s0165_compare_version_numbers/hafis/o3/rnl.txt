(21s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `version1` is less than or equal to 500 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the string parameter `version2` is less than or equal to 500 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `version1` contains only digit characters and the dot character.  
- The string parameter `version2` contains only digit characters and the dot character.  
- All numerical revision values represented in the string parameter `version1` are less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer and are greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer.  
- All numerical revision values represented in the string parameter `version2` are less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer and are greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer.  
- The integer result is equal to 1 or the integer result is equal to 0 or the integer result is equal to -1.  
- If the integer result is equal to 0, the string parameter `version1` and the string parameter `version2` represent numerically identical sequences of revision integers after ignoring leading zeros and treating missing revisions as zero.  
- If the integer result is equal to 1, the first revision index where the numerical value of the revision in the string parameter `version1` differs from the corresponding revision in the string parameter `version2` has a greater numerical value in the string parameter `version1`.  
- If the integer result is equal to -1, the first revision index where the numerical value of the revision in the string parameter `version1` differs from the corresponding revision in the string parameter `version2` has a smaller numerical value in the string parameter `version1`.  
- If the string parameter `version1` is equal to "1.01" and the string parameter `version2` is equal to "1.001", the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `version1` is equal to "1.0" and the string parameter `version2` is equal to "1.0.0", the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `version1` is equal to "0.1" and the string parameter `version2` is equal to "1.1", the integer result is equal to -1.  
- If the string parameter `version1` is equal to "1.0.1" and the string parameter `version2` is equal to "1", the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the string parameter `version1` is equal to "7.5.2.4" and the string parameter `version2` is equal to "7.5.3", the integer result is equal to -1.
