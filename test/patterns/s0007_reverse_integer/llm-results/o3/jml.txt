Explanation of the specification

1. `reverseDigits`  
   • A model (specification-only) function that computes the reversed sequence of decimal digits of a non-negative integer.  
   • It operates on JML’s mathematical type `\bigint`, so there is no danger of overflow inside the specification itself.  
   • The program code may not use 64-bit types, but the specification may use un-bounded mathematics freely.

2. Method contract for `reverse`  
   • `assignable \nothing` declares the method to be free of side–effects.  
   • The post-condition first extracts the sign `s` (+1 or –1).  
   • `rev` is the mathematical reverse of `|x|`.  
   • If `s * rev` still fits into the 32-bit range `[Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE]`, the method must return that value.  
   • Otherwise it must return `0`.  

This JML specification is a literal, formal translation of the informal statement:

“Return the reversed-digit value when it fits into a signed 32-bit integer; otherwise return 0.”
