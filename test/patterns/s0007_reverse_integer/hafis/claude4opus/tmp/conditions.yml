ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 321.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to negative 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 321.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 120 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 21.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is greater_than to 0 and the type_integer_ result is greater_than to 0 , the type_integer_ result has the same digits as the type_integer_ param_x_ in reverse order.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is less_than to 0 and the type_integer_ result is less_than to 0 , the absolute value of the type_integer_ result has the same digits as the absolute value of the type_integer_ param_x_ in reverse order.
- If reversing the digits of the type_integer_ param_x_ would cause the value to be is less_than to negative 2147483648 or is greater_than to 2147483647 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_x_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
