ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- If the decimal digits of the type_integer_ param_x_ reversed form an integer that is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 , the type_integer_ result is equal to that reversed integer.
- If the decimal digits of the type_integer_ param_x_ reversed form an integer that is less_than to negative 2147483648 or is greater_than to 2147483647 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 321.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to negative 123 , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 321.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 120 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 21.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
