(9s elapsed)- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer.  
- If the decimal digits of the integer parameter `x` reversed form an integer that is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer, the integer result is equal to that reversed integer.  
- If the decimal digits of the integer parameter `x` reversed form an integer that is less than the minimum value of java integer or is greater than the maximum value of java integer, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 123, the integer result is equal to 321.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to -123, the integer result is equal to -321.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 120, the integer result is equal to 21.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.
