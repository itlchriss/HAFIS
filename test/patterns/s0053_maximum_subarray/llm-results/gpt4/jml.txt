To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to express the problem's constraints and requirements in a formal specification. JML is used to specify the behavior of Java methods, so I'll provide a JML specification for a Java method that solves the "Maximum Subarray" problem.

```java
//@ public invariant nums != null && nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 100000;
//@ public invariant (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; -10000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000);

public class MaximumSubarray {

    /*@ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 100000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; -10000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000);
      @ ensures \result == (\max int sum; 
      @     (\exists int start, end; 0 <= start && start <= end && end < nums.length;
      @         sum == (\sum int j; start <= j && j <= end; nums[j])));
      @*/
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        // Implementation of the method
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Invariants**: 
  - The array `nums` is not null and its length is between 1 and 100,000.
  - Each element in `nums` is between -10,000 and 10,000.

- **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
  - The input array `nums` must not be null.
  - The length of `nums` must be at least 1 and at most 100,000.
  - Each element in `nums` must be within the specified range.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
  - The result of the method (`\result`) is the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `nums`.
  - This is expressed using a combination of `\max` and `\sum` quantifiers to specify that there exists a start and end index such that the sum of the subarray from `start` to `end` is maximized.

This JML specification provides a formal description of the method's expected behavior, ensuring that any implementation adheres to these constraints and requirements.
