ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s first_element.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 23.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
