ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , at least 1 value appears at least twice in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are unique.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
