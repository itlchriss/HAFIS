ensures:
- result boolean is equal to the true literal when at least 1 value appears 2 or more times in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a.
- result boolean is equal to the false literal when every value appears once in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a.
requires:
- param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a must have length between 1 and 100000 inclusive.
- each element in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a is in the range - 1 1000000000 to 1 1000000000 inclusive.
