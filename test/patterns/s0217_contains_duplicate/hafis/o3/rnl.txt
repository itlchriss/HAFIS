(7s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, at least one value appears at least twice in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, all values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,1], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,4], the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
