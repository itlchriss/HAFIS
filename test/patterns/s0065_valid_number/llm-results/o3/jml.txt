(10s elapsed)Below is a compact, fully-annotated JML contract for a (pure) Java method  
boolean isValidNumber(String s) that has to realise exactly the semantics
described in the exercise.  
The regular expression that appears in the post-condition is a literal and
therefore evaluated by java.lang.String.matches, which is pure and thus legal
inside a JML annotation.

```java
public class NumberUtil {

    /*@
      public normal_behavior
        // -------------  PRE-CONDITIONS  ---------------------------------
        requires s != null;
        requires 1 <= s.length() && s.length() <= 20;

        // every character is guaranteed to be one of the symbols mentioned
        // in the statement (“English letters”, digits, ‘+’, ‘-’, or ‘.’)
        requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < s.length();
                     Character.isLetter(s.charAt(i)) ||
                     Character.isDigit(s.charAt(i))  ||
                     s.charAt(i) == '+' ||
                     s.charAt(i) == '-' ||
                     s.charAt(i) == '.');

        assignable \nothing;                    // the method is side-effect free

        // -------------  POST-CONDITION  ---------------------------------
        ensures \result <==>
                /*  Grammar given in the problem statement expressed as a
                    single regular expression.

                    Explanation of the expression:

                    ^[+-]?                       optional sign
                    (?:                          start main number group
                         \\d+\\.\\d*             "digits '.' [digits]"        (2)
                       | \\d*\\.\\d+             "'.' digits"                 (3)
                       | \\d+                    "digits"                     (integer)
                    )                            end main number group
                    (?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?           optional exponent part       (2.)
                    $                            end of string
                */
                s.matches("^[+-]?(?:\\d+\\.\\d*|\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?$");
     @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ static boolean isValidNumber(String s) {
        // Any correct implementation is allowed.
        // One simple implementation is the body used in the post-condition:
        return s.matches("^[+-]?(?:\\d+\\.\\d*|\\d*\\.\\d+|\\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\\d+)?$");
    }
}
```

Explanation of the contract:

1. Pre-conditions  
   • Non-null string with the length constraint from the exercise.  
   • The loop quantifier states that every character is one that the
     statement allows the caller to pass (letters, digits or one of the three
     punctuation symbols).  
   (The exercise already guarantees this, but writing it explicitly keeps the
   contract self-contained.)

2. assignable \nothing states that the method has no side effects and is thus
   observationally pure.

3. Post-condition  
   The bidirectional implication (`<==>`) expresses total functional
   correctness: the result must be true exactly for those strings that satisfy
   the regular expression, i.e. those that are *valid numbers* by the given
   grammar.

This JML annotation therefore captures the entire natural-language
specification in a precise, machine-checkable form.
