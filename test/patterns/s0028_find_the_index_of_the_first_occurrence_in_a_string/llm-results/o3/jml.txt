(6s elapsed)Below is a self-contained JML specification for a routine that behaves exactly as the informal “strStr()” description requires.  
(The method body can be added later; only the contract is shown here.)

```java
public class Strings {

/*@ public normal_behavior
  @   // -----  PRE-CONDITIONS  -----
  @   requires haystack != null && needle != null;
  @   // length constraints given in the problem statement
  @   requires haystack.length() <= 50000 && needle.length() <= 50000;

  @

Explanation of the clauses:

1. Pre-conditions  
   • `haystack` and `needle` must be non-null.  
   • Their lengths satisfy the numerical constraints.  
   • Every character is a lower-case English letter.  

2. Post-condition for the “empty needle” corner case: result is 0.  

3. When the result is −1, it is because *no* starting index `i` exists such that the substring `haystack[i .. i+|needle|)` equals `needle`.  

4. When the result is not −1, it is  
   a. A legal index inside `haystack`,  
   b. The beginning of a copy of `needle`, and  
   c. The *left-most* such index (no smaller `j` satisfies the same equality).  

These conditions capture precisely the informal specification in a form that can be checked by JML tools.
