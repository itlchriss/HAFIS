ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the index of the first occurrence of the type_string_ param_needle_ in the type_string_ param_haystack_.
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_needle_ is not contained the type_string_ param_haystack_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_needle_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_needle_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_string_ param_haystack_ is empty and the type_string_ param_needle_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
