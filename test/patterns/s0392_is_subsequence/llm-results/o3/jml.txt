    boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t)

that must return true iff the first argument s is a subsequence of the
second argument t.

```java
public class Solution {

    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @   // ----------  PRECONDITIONS  ----------
      @   requires s != null && t != null;               // arguments must exist
      @   requires s.length() <= 100;                    // |s|  ≤ 100
      @   requires t.length() <= 10000;                  // |t|  ≤ 10 000
      @   // only lower-case Latin letters are allowed
      @   requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < s.length();
      @                     s.charAt(i) >= 'a' && s.charAt(i) <= 'z');
      @   requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < t.length();
      @                     t.charAt(i) >= 'a' && t.charAt(i) <= 'z');
      @
      @   // ----------  POSTCONDITION  ----------
      @   //  result  ⇔  “there is an increasing sequence of indices in  t
      @   //              whose characters reproduce  s  exactly”
      @
      @   ensures (\result == true) <==>

      @               idx.length == s.length()                                 // one index per char of s
      @            && (\forall int k; 0 <= k && k < idx.length;                // indices in bounds
      @                     0 <= idx[k] && idx[k] < t.length())

      @                     idx[k] < idx[k + 1])
      @           );
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        // implementation goes here
    }
}
```

Explanation of the main parts:

1. Pre-conditions (`requires`) encode the problem constraints:  
   • both strings exist,  
   • length bounds,  
   • only lowercase letters.

2. The post-condition (`ensures`) uses one existentially quantified
array `idx`.  If such an array exists that  
   a) has exactly as many elements as `s` has characters,  
   b) contains valid indices into `t`,  
   c) is strictly increasing (thus preserving relative order), and  
   d) maps each `s.charAt(k)` to an equal character in `t`,  

   then `s` is a subsequence of `t`.  The specification states that the
returned value must be true exactly in that case and false otherwise.
