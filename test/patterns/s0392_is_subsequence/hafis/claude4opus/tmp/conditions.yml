ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is empty , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_t_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_t_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than to the type_string_ param_t_'s length , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 100.
- The type_string_ param_t_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_t_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
