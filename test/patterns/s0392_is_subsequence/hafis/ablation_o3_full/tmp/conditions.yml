ensures:
- If length of String stry_a is greater_than to length of String stry_b then type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If every character of String stry_a occurs in String stry_b preserving relative order then type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If at least 1 character of String stry_a does not occur in String stry_b preserving relative order then type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
