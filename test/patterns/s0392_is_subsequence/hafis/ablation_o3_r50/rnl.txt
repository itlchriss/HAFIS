(14s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `s` is less than or equal to 100 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The length of the string parameter `t` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The string parameter `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.  
- The string parameter `t` consists only of lowercase English letters.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the string parameter `s` is a subsequence of the string parameter `t`.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the string parameter `s` is not a subsequence of the string parameter `t`.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "abc" and the string parameter `t` is equal to "ahbgdc", the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "axc" and the string parameter `t` is equal to "ahbgdc", the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
