ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_s_ is contained by the type_string_ param_t_.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_s_ is not contained by the type_string_ param_t_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_t_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_t_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_t_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_t_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
