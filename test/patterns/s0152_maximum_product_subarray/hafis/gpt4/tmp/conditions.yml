ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than to negative 2147483648 and is less_than to 2147483647.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 20000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10.
