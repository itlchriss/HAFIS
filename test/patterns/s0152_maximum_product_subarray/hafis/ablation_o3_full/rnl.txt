(14s elapsed)- int[] `arr` must be non null.  
- int[] `arr` must have a length between 1 and 20000 inclusive.  
- every element of int[] `arr` must be between -10 and 10 inclusive.  
- result int equals the maximum product obtainable from any contiguous non empty subarray of int[] `arr`.  
- result int is guaranteed to be within the 32 bit signed integer range.
