ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 13 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
