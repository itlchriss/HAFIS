- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is equal to the total count of the digit 1 in the decimal representations of all integers greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 13, the integer result is equal to 6.
