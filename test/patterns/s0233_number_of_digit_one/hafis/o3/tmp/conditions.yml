ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the total count of the digit 1 in the decimal representations of all integers is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 13 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
