Certainly! Below is the JML (Java Modeling Language) specification for the given problem statement:

```java
/*@
  @ public normal_behavior
  @ requires 0 <= n && n <= Math.pow(10, 9);
  @ ensures \result == (\sum int i; 0 <= i && i <= n; countDigitOne(i));
  @
  @ also
  @
  @ public normal_behavior
  @ requires 0 <= n && n <= Math.pow(10, 9);
  @ ensures \result == 6;
  @
  @ also
  @
  @ public normal_behavior
  @ requires n == 0;
  @ ensures \result == 0;
  @
  @ helper
  @ private normal_behavior
  @ ensures \result == (\num_of int j; 0 <= j && j < 10; j == 1);
  @*/
public int countDigitOne(int n) {
    // Method implementation
}
```

This JML specification describes the behavior of a method `countDigitOne` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the total number of times the digit `1` appears in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`. The specification includes constraints and expected outcomes for different input scenarios.
