(27s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -10000000 and are less than or equal to 10000000.  
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 10000000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is equal to the count of distinct unordered pairs of integer values selected from the integer array parameter `nums` whose absolute difference is equal to the integer parameter `k`.  
- If the integer parameter `k` is equal to 0 and all values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [3,1,4,1,5] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 2, the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,4,5] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 4.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,3,1,5,4] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 1.
