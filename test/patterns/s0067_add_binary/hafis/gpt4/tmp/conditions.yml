ensures:
- The type_string_ result only contains the chry_a and the chry_b.
- The type_string_ result's length is greater_than_or_equal to the maximum length of the type_string_ param_a_ and the type_string_ param_b_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_a_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_b_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_a_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_b_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_a_ only contains the chry_a and the chry_b.
- The type_string_ param_b_ only contains the chry_a and the chry_b.
- The type_string_ param_a_'s first_element is not_equal to the chry_a unless the type_string_ param_a_ only contains single_zero.
- The type_string_ param_b_'s first_element is not_equal to the chry_a unless the type_string_ param_b_ only contains single_zero.
