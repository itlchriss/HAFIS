(15s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `a` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- The length of the string parameter `b` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- The string parameter `a` consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string parameter `b` consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string parameter `a` does not contain leading zeros unless the string parameter `a` is equal to the string literal "0".  
- The string parameter `b` does not contain leading zeros unless the string parameter `b` is equal to the string literal "0".  
- The string result consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string result does not contain leading zeros unless the string result is equal to the string literal "0".  
- The integer value of the string result is equal to the sum between the integer value of the string parameter `a` and the integer value of the string parameter `b`.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to the string literal "11" and the string parameter `b` is equal to the string literal "1", the string result is equal to the string literal "100".  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to the string literal "1010" and the string parameter `b` is equal to the string literal "1011", the string result is equal to the string literal "10101".
