(10s elapsed)- String parameter `a` must contain at least one character and every character must be either '0' or '1' with no leading '0' unless the entire string equals "0"  
- String parameter `b` must contain at least one character and every character must be either '0' or '1' with no leading '0' unless the entire string equals "0"  
- String result equals the binary representation of the sum of the integer values represented by parameters `a` and `b`  
- String result must consist only of characters '0' or '1'  
- String result must not have a leading '0' unless its length is one  
- String result length is either the maximum of the lengths of parameters `a` and `b` or that maximum plus one
