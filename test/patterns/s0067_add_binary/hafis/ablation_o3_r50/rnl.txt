- The length of the string parameter `b` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `a` consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string parameter `b` consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string parameter `a` does not contain leading zeros except when the string parameter `a` is equal to "0".  
- The string parameter `b` does not contain leading zeros except when the string parameter `b` is equal to "0".  
- The string result consists only of the characters 0 and 1.  
- The string result interpreted as a binary integer is equal to the sum of the binary integers represented by the string parameters `a` and `b`.  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to "11" and the string parameter `b` is equal to "1", the string result is equal to "100".  
- If the string parameter `a` is equal to "1010" and the string parameter `b` is equal to "1011", the string result is equal to "10101".
