(Only the specification is given – the method body can be filled with any
implementation that satisfies the contract.)

```java

Explanation of the most important clauses:

• `requires` clauses encode exactly the constraints from the exercise  
  (length limits, allowed characters, and the “no leading zero” rule).  
• `ensures` clauses guarantee  
  1. the returned string is well-formed binary without leading zeros, and  
  2. its numeric value (interpreted as base-2 with `BigInteger`) equals the
   sum of the numeric values of the two input strings.  
• `assignable \nothing` and the `pure` annotation state that the method must
  have no observable side effects—appropriate for a deterministic, functional
  routine like “Add Binary”.
