(12s elapsed)- int[] 'nums' must be non null with length at least one and at most ten thousand and each element of int[] 'nums' must be an int between zero and one hundred thousand inclusive  
- If int[] 'nums' has length equal to one then boolean result is true  
- If boolean result is true then the last index of int[] 'nums' is reachable from index zero by a sequence of jumps where each jump length is not greater than the value stored at the departure index  
- If the last index of int[] 'nums' is not reachable from index zero by any sequence of jumps where each jump length is not greater than the value stored at the departure index then boolean result is false
