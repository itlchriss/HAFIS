ensures:
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
