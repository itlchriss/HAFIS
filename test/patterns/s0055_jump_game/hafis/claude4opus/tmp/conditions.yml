ensures:
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , there exists at least 1 index in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ that cannot reach the last index.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the last index of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is reached from the first index.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 100000.
