If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists at least 1 finite sequence of indices that starts with 0 , ends with the index that is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ 's length - 1 , and for every 2 consecutive indices in the sequence the difference between the second index and the first index is greater_than to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the value located at the first index in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ .
