- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 100000.
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, there exists at least one finite sequence of indices that starts with 0, ends with the index that is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums` minus 1, and for every two consecutive indices in the sequence the difference between the second index and the first index is greater than 0 and is less than or equal to the value located at the first index in the integer array parameter `nums`.
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, no sequence of indices satisfying the conditions described in the previous specification exists.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,3,1,1,4], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [3,2,1,0,4], the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
