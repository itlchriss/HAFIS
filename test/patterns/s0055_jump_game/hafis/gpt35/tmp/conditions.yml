ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , it means that it is possible to reach the last index of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , it means that it is not possible to reach the last index of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
