The Java code that will actually compute the answer is replaced by “…”, because only the
behavioural contract is requested.

Explanations of the main parts of the contract

1. Preconditions (`requires`)
   • `nums` must exist.  
   • Its length must be in the interval [1, 10 000].  
   • Every element of `nums` must be in [0, 100 000].

2. The model predicate `reachable`
   `reachable(a,s,t)` is true exactly when index `t` can be reached
   from index `s` under the stated jumping rules.  
   – It is written as a recursive, pure model function so that it can
     be used freely in specifications without affecting run-time code.  
   – The loop in the body is furnished with standard invariants so that
     current JML tools accept the definition.

3. Post-condition (`ensures`)
   The result returned by `canJump` is true if and only if the last
   position (`nums.length – 1`) is reachable from the first position
   (0) according to the model predicate above.

The specification thus captures the complete informal requirement:
“return true iff one can jump from the first element to the last
following the maximal jump lengths stored in the array.”
