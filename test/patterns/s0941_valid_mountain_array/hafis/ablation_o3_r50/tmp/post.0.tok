If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ 's length is greater_than_or_equal to 3 and there exists an integer index i such that i is greater_than to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ 's length - 1 and the subsequence of values from index 0 up to index i strictly increases and the subsequence of values from index i down to the last index strictly decreases .
