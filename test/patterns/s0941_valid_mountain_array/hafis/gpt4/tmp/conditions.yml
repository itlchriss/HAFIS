ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an index the type_character_ chrs_a such that the type_string_ strs_b the type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length - 1 , and the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is strictly increasing up to index the type_character_ chrs_c and strictly decreasing after index the type_character_ chrs_d.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ does not satisfy the conditions of a valid mountain array.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
