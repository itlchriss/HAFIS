If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , for every index that is smaller than the position of the largest value , the value at that index in the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is strictly is less_than to the value at the next index , and for every index that is greater_than_or_equal to the position of the largest value and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ 's length - 1 , the value at that index in the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is strictly is greater_than to the value at the next index .
