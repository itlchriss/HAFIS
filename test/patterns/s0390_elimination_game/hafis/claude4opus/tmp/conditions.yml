ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- The type_integer_ result is the last remaining number after alternating elimination from left to right and right to left.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
