ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the last number that remains in the integer array the type_string_ strs_a after applying the elimination algorithm.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 9 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
