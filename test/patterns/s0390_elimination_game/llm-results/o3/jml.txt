(14s elapsed)Below is one possible way of turning the informal problem statement into a precise JML (Java Modeling Language) specification for a Java method

    public static int lastRemaining(int n);

The idea is:

1.  We bound the input exactly as in the statement.
2.  We describe the result purely mathematically with a ghost/model
    function `lastRemainingSpec`.  
    (The well-known closed form for this problem is
    `f(n) = 2*(1 + n/2 – f(n/2))` with the base case `f(1)=1`.)
3.  The implementation of `lastRemaining` is completely unconstrained
    except that it must return the value computed by the model
    function and must not have any visible side effects
    (`assignable \nothing`).

```

```

Explanations:

• `requires` encodes the constraint `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁹`.  
• `lastRemainingSpec` is declared `pure model`, hence it can be used
  freely in specifications but never appears in the compiled code.  
• The only post-condition is that the concrete implementation must
  return exactly the value delivered by the model function.  
• `assignable \nothing` expresses that the observable state (fields,
  array elements, …) is left unchanged; the function is “pure”.
