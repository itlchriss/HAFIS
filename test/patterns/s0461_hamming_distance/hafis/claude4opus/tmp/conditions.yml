ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 32.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to the type_integer_ param_y_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 1 and the type_integer_ param_y_ is equal to 4 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_x_ is equal to 3 and the type_integer_ param_y_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_x_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- The type_integer_ param_y_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
