(9s elapsed)- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- The integer parameter `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 31.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to the integer parameter `y`, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 1 and the integer parameter `y` is equal to 4, the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 3 and the integer parameter `y` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 1.  
- The integer result is equal to the count of bit positions where the binary representation of the integer parameter `x` differs from the binary representation of the integer parameter `y`.
