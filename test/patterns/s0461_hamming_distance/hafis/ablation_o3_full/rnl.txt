(6s elapsed)- Given int parameters 'x' and 'y' where 0 less than or equal to 'x' less than or equal to 2147483647 and 0 less than or equal to 'y' less than or equal to 2147483647 the method returns a non negative int result  
- If int parameters 'x' and 'y' are equal the int result equals 0  
- For any int parameters 'x' and 'y' the int result equals the count of bit positions at which the binary representations of 'x' and 'y' differ  
- The int result is at least 0 and at most 31
