ensures:
- If int parameters the chry_a and the chry_b are equal the int result equals 0.
- For any int parameters the chry_a and the chry_b the int result equals the count of bit positions at which the binary representations of the chry_c and the chry_d differ.
- The int result is at least 0 and at most 31.
