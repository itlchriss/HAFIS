(11s elapsed)- The integer parameter `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer  
- The integer parameter `y` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 31  
- The integer result is equal to the number of bit positions where the binary representation of the integer parameter `x` and the binary representation of the integer parameter `y` are different  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 1 and the integer parameter `y` is equal to 4, the integer result is equal to 2  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to 3 and the integer parameter `y` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 1  
- If the integer parameter `x` is equal to the integer parameter `y`, the integer result is equal to 0
