     * between two non–negative 32-bit integers.

Explanation of the main JML clauses:

1. `requires`: encodes the constraint `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 2³¹ − 1`.
2. `assignable \nothing`: states that the method has no side effects.
3. The first `ensures` line guarantees the result is a legal distance (0–31).
4. The second `ensures` line defines the result precisely:  
   `\num_of` counts the indices `i` (0 – 31) for which the bits of `x` and `y` differ after an unsigned right-shift (`>>>`) and masking with `1`.
