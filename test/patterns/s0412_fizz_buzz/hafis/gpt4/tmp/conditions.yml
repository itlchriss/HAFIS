ensures:
- The type_list_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_list_ result contains the string stry_a , the index of stry_b + 1 is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- If the type_list_ result contains the string stry_a , the index of stry_b + 1 is divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.
- If the type_list_ result contains the string stry_a , the index of stry_b + 1 is divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 3.
- If the type_list_ result contains a string that is equal to numeric representation of an integer , the index of that string + 1 is not divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
