ensures:
- The length of the string type_list_ result is equal to the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the string located at index i - 1 of the string type_list_ result is equal to the string literal stry_a , the integer i is divisible by 3 and is divisible by 5.
- If the string located at index i - 1 of the string type_list_ result is equal to the string literal stry_a , the integer i is divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.
- If the string located at index i - 1 of the string type_list_ result is equal to the string literal stry_a , the integer i is divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 3.
- If the string located at index i - 1 of the string type_list_ result is equal to the string_representation of the integer i , the integer i is not divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the string type_list_ result is equal to the sequence stry_a , stry_b , stry_c.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 5 , the string type_list_ result is equal to the sequence stry_a , stry_b , stry_c , stry_d , stry_e.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 15 , the string type_list_ result is equal to the sequence stry_a , stry_b , stry_c , stry_d , stry_e , stry_f , stry_g , stry_h , stry_i , stry_j , stry_k , stry_l , stry_m , stry_n , stry_o.
