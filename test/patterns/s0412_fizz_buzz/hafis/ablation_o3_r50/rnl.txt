- The length of the string list result is equal to the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the string located at index i minus 1 of the string list result is equal to the string literal "FizzBuzz", the integer i is divisible by 3 and is divisible by 5.  
- If the string located at index i minus 1 of the string list result is equal to the string literal "Fizz", the integer i is divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.  
- If the string located at index i minus 1 of the string list result is equal to the string literal "Buzz", the integer i is divisible by 5 and is not divisible by 3.  
- If the string located at index i minus 1 of the string list result is equal to the string representation of the integer i, the integer i is not divisible by 3 and is not divisible by 5.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 3, the string list result is equal to the sequence "1", "2", "Fizz".  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 5, the string list result is equal to the sequence "1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz".  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 15, the string list result is equal to the sequence "1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz".
