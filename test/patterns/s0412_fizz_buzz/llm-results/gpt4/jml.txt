To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the behavior of the method that solves the problem. JML is used to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for Java methods. Here's how you can express the Fizz Buzz problem in JML:

```java
/*@
  @ requires 1 <= n && n <= 10000;
  @ ensures \result.length == n;
  @ ensures (\forall int i; 1 <= i && i <= n;
  @     (\result[i-1].equals("FizzBuzz") <==> (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0)) &&
  @     (\result[i-1].equals("Fizz") <==> (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 != 0)) &&
  @     (\result[i-1].equals("Buzz") <==> (i % 5 == 0 && i % 3 != 0)) &&
  @     (\result[i-1].equals(Integer.toString(i)) <==> (i % 3 != 0 && i % 5 != 0))
  @ );
  @*/
public String[] fizzBuzz(int n) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Precondition (`requires`)**: The input `n` must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive, as specified by the problem constraints.

- **Postcondition (`ensures`)**:
  - The length of the result array must be `n`.
  - For each index `i` (1-indexed in the problem, but 0-indexed in Java arrays), the following conditions must hold:
    - If `i` is divisible by both 3 and 5, the result at index `i-1` should be "FizzBuzz".
    - If `i` is divisible by 3 but not by 5, the result at index `i-1` should be "Fizz".
    - If `i` is divisible by 5 but not by 3, the result at index `i-1` should be "Buzz".
    - If `i` is not divisible by either 3 or 5, the result at index `i-1` should be the string representation of `i`.

This JML specification describes the expected behavior of the `fizzBuzz` method, ensuring that it produces the correct output for any valid input `n`.
