Feel free to copy the comments into an existing class or adapt the header to your coding style.

Explanation of the clauses:

1. `requires` expresses the domain constraint `1 ≤ n ≤ 10⁴`.
2. The first two `ensures` clauses state general facts about the returned array (non-null and the correct length).
3. The remaining `ensures` clauses partition the indices `0 … n-1` (which correspond to the numbers `1 … n`) into the four mutually exclusive cases of the informal specification, asserting the exact string that must appear in each situation.

Every index `i` refers to the array position, so the number being classified is `i + 1`.
