Here's the JML specification for the FizzBuzz problem:

```java
public class FizzBuzz {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires 1 <= n && n <= 10000;
      @ ensures \result != null;
      @ ensures \result.length == n;
      @ ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < n; 
      @     \result[i] != null &&
      @     ((i+1) % 15 == 0 ==> \result[i].equals("FizzBuzz")) &&
      @     ((i+1) % 15 != 0 && (i+1) % 3 == 0 ==> \result[i].equals("Fizz")) &&
      @     ((i+1) % 15 != 0 && (i+1) % 5 == 0 ==> \result[i].equals("Buzz")) &&
      @     ((i+1) % 3 != 0 && (i+1) % 5 != 0 ==> \result[i].equals(String.valueOf(i+1)))
      @ );
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ String[] fizzBuzz(int n) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Key points in this JML specification:

1. **Precondition** (`requires`): `n` must be between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive)

2. **Postconditions** (`ensures`):
   - The result is not null
   - The result array has length `n`
   - For each element in the array (using 0-based indexing internally):
     - The element is not null
     - If the 1-indexed position (i+1) is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), the element equals "FizzBuzz"
     - If the 1-indexed position is divisible by 3 but not 15, the element equals "Fizz"
     - If the 1-indexed position is divisible by 5 but not 15, the element equals "Buzz"
     - If the 1-indexed position is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, the element equals the string representation of the 1-indexed position

3. The method is marked as `pure` since it has no side effects and only returns a value based on its input.

Note: The specification uses `(i+1)` because Java arrays are 0-indexed, but the problem description uses 1-indexed positions. So `\result[0]` corresponds to position 1, `\result[1]` to position 2, etc.
