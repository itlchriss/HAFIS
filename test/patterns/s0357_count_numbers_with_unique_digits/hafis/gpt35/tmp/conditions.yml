ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the count of all numbers with unique digits in the range of 0 to 10_pow_n , excluding numbers with repeated digits.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 91.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 8.
