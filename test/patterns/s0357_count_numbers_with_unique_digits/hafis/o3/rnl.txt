(16s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 8.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 2, the integer result is equal to 91.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2345851.  
- The integer result is equal to the count of all integers `x` such that `x` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x` is less than 10 raised to the power of the integer parameter `n` and all digits in `x` are unique.
