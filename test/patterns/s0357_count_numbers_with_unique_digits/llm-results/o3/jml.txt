(19s elapsed)Below is a self-contained Java signature together with a JML contract that captures, and only captures, the informal requirement that

 • the incoming argument n must be between 0 and 8 (inclusive), and  
 • the returned value is the exact number of integers x such that  
   0 ≤ x < 10ⁿ  and x contains no repeated decimal digit.

The auxiliary JML “model” functions that appear in the post-condition are purely
specification-time abstractions; they do not have to be implemented (although
you may do so if you want run-time checking).

```java
public class UniqueDigits357 {

    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @   requires 0 <= n && n <= 8;
      @
      @   ensures \result ==
      @           (\num_of int x ;                          // number of …
      @                0 <= x && x < pow10(n)              //   … values x in range
      @                && uniqueDigits(x)                  //   … whose digits are unique
      @           );
      @
      @   // obvious frame condition: the method is pure
      @   assignable \nothing;
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ static int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        // … implementation goes here …
    }
    
    
    /*------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *  Pure model helpers used only in the specification
     *------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

    /*@ public pure model static int pow10(int k); @*/
    /*@ public pure model static boolean uniqueDigits(int x); @*/
}
```

Explanations of the model helpers (informal, because they live only in the
specification space):

1. `pow10(k)` evaluates to 10ᵏ.  
   (A concrete implementation could simply return
   `(int) java.lang.Math.pow(10,k)`; since k ≤ 8 the result always fits
   into a 32-bit int.)

2. `uniqueDigits(x)` is true iff every decimal digit occurs at most once in the
   standard base-10 representation of `x`.  Formally it could be defined by

```java
/*@ public pure model static boolean uniqueDigits(int x) =
      (\forall int d ; 0 <= d && d <= 9
         ==> (\num_of int pos ; digitAt(x,pos) == d) <= 1); @*/
```

but the JML specification above keeps it abstract to stay technology-agnostic.

That is the entire JML formalisation of the original problem statement.
