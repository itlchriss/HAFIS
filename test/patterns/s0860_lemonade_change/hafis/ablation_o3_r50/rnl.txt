(13s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `bills` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `bills` are equal to 5 or are equal to 10 or are equal to 20.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, each customer represented by the integer array parameter `bills` receives correct change when the price of one lemonade is equal to 5.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, at least one customer represented by the integer array parameter `bills` does not receive correct change when the price of one lemonade is equal to 5.  
- If the integer array parameter `bills` is equal to [5,5,5,10,20], boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `bills` is equal to [5,5,10,10,20], boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- Boolean result is equal to the true literal only if for every processed prefix of the integer array parameter `bills` the cumulative value of collected bills minus five times the number of processed customers is greater than or equal to zero.
