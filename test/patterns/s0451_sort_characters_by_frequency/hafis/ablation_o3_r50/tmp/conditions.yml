ensures:
- The type_string_ result has the same length as the type_string_ param_s_ and every character appears the same number of times in the type_string_ result and in the type_string_ param_s_.
- All occurrences of each unique character are contiguous in the string result.
- Whenever 2 different characters are contained by consecutively in the type_string_ result the number of occurrences of the leading character in the type_string_ param_s_ is greater_than_or_equal to the number of occurrences of the following character in the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ contains uppercase_alphabets lowercase_alphabets and digits.
