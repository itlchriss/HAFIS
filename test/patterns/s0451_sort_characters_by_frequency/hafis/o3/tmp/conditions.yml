ensures:
- The type_string_ result's length is equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- For every 2 unique characters that occur in the type_string_ param_s_ , if the frequency of the type_string_ param_s_'s first_element is greater_than to the frequency of the second character in the type_string_ param_s_ , every occurrence of the first_element appears in the type_string_ result before any occurrence of the second character.
- For each unique character that occurs in the type_string_ param_s_ , all of its occurrences are contained by consecutively in the string result.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains uppercase_alphabets lowercase_alphabets and digits.
