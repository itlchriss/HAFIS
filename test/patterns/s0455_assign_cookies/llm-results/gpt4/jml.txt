To convert the given problem description into JML (Java Modeling Language), we need to specify the preconditions, postconditions, and invariants for the method that solves the problem. Here's a possible JML specification for a method that assigns cookies to children:

```java
/*@
  @ requires g != null && s != null;
  @ requires g.length >= 1 && g.length <= 30000;
  @ requires s.length >= 0 && s.length <= 30000;
  @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < g.length; 1 <= g[i] && g[i] <= Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  @ requires (\forall int j; 0 <= j && j < s.length; 1 <= s[j] && s[j] <= Integer.MAX_VALUE);
  @ ensures \result >= 0 && \result <= g.length;
  @ ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < g.length; 
  @             (\exists int j; 0 <= j && j < s.length; s[j] >= g[i]) ==> 
  @             (\exists int k; 0 <= k && k < \result; s[k] >= g[i]));
  @*/
public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
    // Method implementation goes here
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Preconditions (`requires`):**
  - `g` and `s` are not null.
  - The length of `g` is between 1 and 30,000.
  - The length of `s` is between 0 and 30,000.
  - Each element in `g` is between 1 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
  - Each element in `s` is between 1 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

- **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
  - The result is between 0 and the length of `g`, as the maximum number of content children cannot exceed the number of children.
  - For every child `i` that can be content with at least one cookie, there exists a cookie `k` in the result that satisfies the child's greed factor.

This JML specification provides a formal contract for the method, ensuring that it behaves correctly according to the problem's requirements.
