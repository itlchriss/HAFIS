ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_g_'s length and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_g_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_s_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_g_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_s_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_g_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 30000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 30000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_array_ param_g_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_s_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
