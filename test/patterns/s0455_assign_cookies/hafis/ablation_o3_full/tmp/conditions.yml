ensures:
- result int is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- result int is less_than_or_equal to the length of int[] stry_a.
- result int is less_than_or_equal to the length of int[] stry_a.
- result int equals 0 when the length of int[] stry_a equals 0.
- For any feasible assignment that each child receives at most 1 cookie whose size is greater_than_or_equal to that child’s greed factor the number of content children in that assignment does not exceed result int.
- There exists a feasible assignment that each child receives at most 1 cookie whose size is greater_than_or_equal to that child’s greed factor and the number of content children in that assignment equals result int.
requires:
- The param_int_[] stry_a is not null.
