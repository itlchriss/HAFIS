ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the minimum between the type_integer_array_ param_g_'s length and the type_integer_array_ param_s_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_s_'s length is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_g_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_s_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_g_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_s_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 30000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_g_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 1 and are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- The type_integer_array_ param_s_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 1 and are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
