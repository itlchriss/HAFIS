ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ starts with the chry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ contains stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If any substring of 2 consecutive digits in the type_string_ param_s_ starts with the chry_a and is not equal to stry_a or stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains digits.
