ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains digits and the type_string_ param_s_'s first_element is equal to the chry_a.
