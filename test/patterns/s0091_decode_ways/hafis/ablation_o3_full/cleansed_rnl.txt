- If the first character of String `s` is the digit 0 then the int result is 0
- If no possible grouping of one- or two-digit substrings of String `s` yields only numeric values from 1 to 26 with no leading zeros then the int result is 0
- If at least one grouping of one- or two-digit substrings of String `s` yields only numeric values from 1 to 26 with no leading zeros then the int result is a positive integer
- The int result is always within the range of a signed 32-bit integer
