(8s elapsed)- For any String `s` whose length is at least 1 and at most 100 and whose characters are all digits 0 through 9 inclusive, the int result equals the number of distinct complete decodings of `s` under the mapping 1 to 26 to the letters A to Z without allowing leading zeros in any grouped number  
- If the first character of String `s` is the digit 0 then the int result is 0  
- If no possible grouping of one- or two-digit substrings of String `s` yields only numeric values from 1 to 26 with no leading zeros then the int result is 0  
- If at least one grouping of one- or two-digit substrings of String `s` yields only numeric values from 1 to 26 with no leading zeros then the int result is a positive integer  
- The int result is always within the range of a signed 32-bit integer
