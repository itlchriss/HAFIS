(13s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `s` is less than or equal to 100 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `s` only consists of digits.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to 2147483647 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "12" the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "226" the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "0" the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "06" the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer result is equal to 0 the string parameter `s` has no valid decoding using the mapping from the string "1" to the character 'A' through the string "26" to the character 'Z'.
