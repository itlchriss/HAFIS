ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 0 the type_string_ param_s_ has no valid decoding using the mapping from the string stry_a to the character the chry_a through the string stry_b to the character the chry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains digits.
