(The Java body of the method is left out on purpose – only the formal contract is required.)

Explanation of the contract.

1. Preconditions (requires):
   • `s` is non-null.  
   • `1 ≤ s.length() ≤ 100`.  
   • Every character of `s` is a decimal digit.

2. Postconditions (ensures):
   • The result is a non-negative 32-bit quantity – i.e. it fits into `int`.  
   • The result equals the mathematical function `countDecodings(s)` that is
     specified in the ghost section.  
     The ghost method expresses the exact informal rules:
       – If the string is empty, there is one valid decoding (the empty one).  
       – A string that starts with `'0'` cannot be decoded.  
       – Otherwise we may consume one digit (always allowed) or
         two digits when the first two characters form a value
         between 10 and 26; the number of decodings is the sum of both
         possibilities.

Because `countDecodings` is declared `pure` and never implemented,
it serves solely as a mathematical abstraction, allowing any concrete
implementation of `numDecodings` (DP, recursion, etc.) to be verified
against the original informal specification.
