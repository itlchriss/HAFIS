(14s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 10000 and are greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer parameter `k` is less than or equal to 10000 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to the difference between the maximum value of the integer array parameter `nums` and the minimum value of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,10] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 2, the integer result is equal to 6.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,3,6] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 3, the integer result is equal to 0.
