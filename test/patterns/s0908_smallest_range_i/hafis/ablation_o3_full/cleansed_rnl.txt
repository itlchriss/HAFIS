- The method requires every element of `int[]` `nums` to lie within the inclusive range zero to ten thousand
- The method requires `int` `k` to lie within the inclusive range zero to ten thousand
- If the length of `int[]` `nums` is one then result of type int is zero
- If the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in `int[]` `nums` is less than or equal to twice `int` `k` then result of type int is zero
- Otherwise result of type int equals the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in `int[]` `nums` minus twice `int` `k`
- Result of type int is always greater than or equal to zero
