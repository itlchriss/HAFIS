ensures:
- If the length of the type_string_ strs_a the type_string_ strs_b is 1 then result of type int is 0.
- If the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the type_string_ strs_a the type_string_ strs_b is less_than_or_equal to twice the type_string_ strs_c the type_character_ chrs_d then result of type int is 0.
- Otherwise result of type int equals the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the type_string_ strs_a the type_string_ strs_b - twice the type_string_ strs_c the type_character_ chrs_d.
