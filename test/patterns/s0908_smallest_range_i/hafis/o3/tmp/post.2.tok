If the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is greater_than to 2 times the type_integer_ param_k_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ - 2 times the type_integer_ param_k_ .
