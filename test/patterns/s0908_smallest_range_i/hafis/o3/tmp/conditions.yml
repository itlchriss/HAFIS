ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is greater_than to 2 times the type_integer_ param_k_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ - 2 times the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the difference between the maximum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ and the minimum value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is less_than_or_equal to 2 times the type_integer_ param_k_ , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
