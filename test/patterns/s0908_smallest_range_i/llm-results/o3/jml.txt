(9s elapsed)Below is a compact JML contract that captures the whole problem statement for a (pure) Java method  

    int smallestRangeI(int[ ] nums, int k)

It expresses  
• all input‐domain constraints, and  
• the exact value that has to be returned, i.e. the minimum achievable score after every
  array element may be shifted once by any integer in [-k, k].

```
public class SmallestRangeI {

/*@ public normal_behavior
  @   requires nums != null;                               // array is provided
  @   requires 1 <= nums.length && nums.length <= 10000;   // constraint 1
  @   requires 0 <= k && k <= 10000;                       // constraint 3
  @   requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length;
  @                        0 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 10000); // constraint 2
  @
  @   assignable \nothing;         // pure function – does not modify any state
  @
  @   // Abbreviations for current maximum and minimum
  @   def max = (\max int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]);
  @   def min = (\min int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]);
  @
  @   // Closed-form answer obtained from the optimisation problem
  @   ensures (max - min <= 2 * k)
  @           ==>  \result == 0;
  @
  @   ensures (max - min >  2 * k)
  @           ==>  \result == max - min - 2 * k;
  @
  @   // Some cheap sanity bounds for free
  @   ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 10000;
  @*/
  public /*@ pure @*/ int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k);
}
```

Explanation of the post-conditions

1. Let `max = max(nums)` and `min = min(nums)`.  
2. Each element can be moved up or down by at most `k`, so in the best case the
   entire spread can shrink by `2 k`.  
3. If the original spread `max − min` is already ≤ `2 k`, it can be collapsed to
   0; otherwise the remaining spread is `max − min − 2 k`.  
4. The two `ensures` clauses encode this exact piecewise function. Together they
   uniquely determine `\result`.

This contract therefore states precisely what any correct implementation of
`smallestRangeI` must return, while remaining faithful to all constraints in
