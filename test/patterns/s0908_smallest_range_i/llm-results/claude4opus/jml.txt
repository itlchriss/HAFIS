Looking at this problem, I need to convert the specification into JML (Java Modeling Language). The key insight is that to minimize the score (max - min), we should increase the minimum values and decrease the maximum values by at most k.

Here's the JML specification:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 1 && nums.length <= 10000;
      @ requires k >= 0 && k <= 10000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @           nums[i] >= 0 && nums[i] <= 10000);
      @ ensures \result >= 0;
      @ ensures \result == Math.max(0, 
      @           (\max int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]) - 
      @           (\min int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]) - 2 * k);
      @ ensures \result <= (\max int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]) - 
      @                    (\min int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; nums[i]);
      @ ensures (\forall int[] modifiedNums; 
      @           modifiedNums != null && modifiedNums.length == nums.length &&
      @           (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @             modifiedNums[i] >= nums[i] - k && 
      @             modifiedNums[i] <= nums[i] + k);
      @           \result <= (\max int i; 0 <= i && i < modifiedNums.length; modifiedNums[i]) -
      @                     (\min int i; 0 <= i && i < modifiedNums.length; modifiedNums[i]));
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Implementation would go here
        return 0;
    }
}
```

Key aspects of this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums` is not null
   - Array length is between 1 and 10,000
   - `k` is between 0 and 10,000
   - All elements in `nums` are between 0 and 10,000

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - Result is non-negative
   - The result equals `max(0, originalMax - originalMin - 2*k)` (this is the mathematical solution)
   - Result is at most the original score (we can only improve or maintain the score)
   - For any valid modification of the array (where each element is changed by at most k), the result is optimal

3. **Method purity:** The method is marked as `pure` since it doesn't modify the input array or have side effects.

The mathematical insight captured in the second `ensures` clause is that the optimal strategy is to:
- Decrease all values greater than or equal to `originalMax - k` by `k`
- Increase all values less than or equal to `originalMin + k` by `k`

This results in a new range of `[originalMin + k, originalMax - k]`, giving a score of `max(0, originalMax - originalMin - 2*k)`.
