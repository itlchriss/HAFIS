(8s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 400.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum obtainable sum of elements chosen from the integer array parameter `nums` under the condition that no two chosen elements are adjacent within the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,1], the integer result is equal to 4.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,7,9,3,1], the integer result is equal to 12.
