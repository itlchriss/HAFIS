ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s summation.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 12.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 400 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
