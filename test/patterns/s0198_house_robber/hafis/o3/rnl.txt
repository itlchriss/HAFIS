(20s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 400 and are greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the sum of all the values in the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to the sum of all the values in any subset of indices of the integer array parameter `nums` where no two indices are consecutive.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3,1], the integer result is equal to 4.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [2,7,9,3,1], the integer result is equal to 12.
