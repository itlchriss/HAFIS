```java
public class HouseRobber {

    /**
     * Returns the maximum amount of money that can be robbed from a row of
     * houses without ever robbing two adjacent houses.
     *
     * @param nums  an array whose i-th element is the amount of money stashed
     *              in house i (0-based)
     * @return      the largest attainable sum that respects the adjacency
     *              constraint
     */
    /*@
        public normal_behavior
        requires nums != null;
        requires 1 <= nums.length && nums.length <= 100;
        requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length;
                     0 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 400);

        // -------------- Functional specification ---------------------------
        // There exists at least one admissible rob-plan that realises \result
        ensures (\exists boolean robbed[];
                   robbed.length == nums.length &&

        // -------------- Frame condition ------------------------------------

Explanation of the main JML clauses:

1. Preconditions (`requires`)
   • `nums` is non-null and its length obeys 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.  
   • Every entry respects 0 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 400.

2. Post-conditions (`ensures`)
   • Existence: there is an array `robbed[]` (a Boolean choice for every
     house) that satisfies the “no two adjacent true” constraint and whose
     associated sum equals `\result`.
   • Optimality: for every admissible `robbed[]`, its sum is **at most**
     `\result`; hence `\result` is the maximum possible value.

3. `assignable \nothing` marks the method as *observationally pure*: it
   neither writes into `nums` nor modifies any visible state, which matches
   the problem’s purely functional nature.

This JML annotation captures precisely the informal specification given in
the original problem statement.
