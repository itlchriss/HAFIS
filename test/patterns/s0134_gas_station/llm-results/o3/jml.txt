(24s elapsed)Below is a self-contained JML contract that captures exactly the informal requirements of the “Gas Station” problem.  
The contract is written for the classical LeetCode signature

    int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost)

and assumes the method is placed in a class called Solution.

```
public class Solution {

    /*@
      // ----------  PRECONDITIONS  ----------
      // basic well-formedness of the two input arrays
      requires gas  != null;
      requires cost != null;
      requires gas.length  == cost.length;

      // size and value constraints taken literally from the statement
      requires 1  <= gas.length  && gas.length  <= 100_000;
      requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < gas.length;
                   0 <= gas[i]  && gas[i]  <= 10_000
                && 0 <= cost[i] && cost[i] <= 10_000);

      // ----------  FRAME CONDITION ----------
      assignable \nothing;          // the routine is pure (no visible side effects)

      // ----------  POSTCONDITIONS ----------
      // the returned value is either a valid index or –1
      ensures \result == -1
           || (0 <= \result && \result < gas.length);

      // result == -1  ⇔  there is NO start position that allows a full tour
      ensures (\result == -1)
              <==>
              (\forall int s; 0 <= s && s < gas.length;
                   !canTravel(gas, cost, s));

      // if the routine returns a proper index, that index really works …
      ensures (\result != -1) ==> canTravel(gas, cost, \result);

      // … and it is the ONLY one that works (uniqueness)
      ensures (\result != -1)
              ==> (\forall int s; 0 <= s && s < gas.length && s != \result;
                      !canTravel(gas, cost, s));
    @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost);

    /*@ public pure model boolean canTravel(int[] gas, int[] cost, int start) =

                  - cost[(start + j) % gas.length]) >= 0)

          // … and after n steps we are back with a non-negative balance
       &&  (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < gas.length;
               gas[(start + j) % gas.length]
             - cost[(start + j) % gas.length]) >= 0;

Explanation of the most important clauses

1. Preconditions  
   – Reproduce the size, range and value limits appearing verbatim in the problem statement.  
   – Guarantee non-null arrays of equal length.

2. `assignable \nothing`  
   Marks the method as _pure_ (it does not modify any location visible to the caller).

3. `canTravel` (model predicate)  
   Formalises the intuitive “can you finish the whole circle starting from
   station start without the tank ever going negative?”  
   • The first conjunct ensures the fuel balance is non-negative after every
     intermediate hop.  
   • The second conjunct ensures the final balance (after completing `n` hops) is
     also non-negative.

4. Postconditions  
   • If the method says “-1” then _no_ start index is feasible.  
   • If it supplies an index, that index is feasible and all others are not
     (uniqueness).  
   • In all cases a returned index, if any, is inside the valid range.

This JML specification is a faithful, formal translation of the natural-language
requirements and is ready to be used by runtime assertion checkers or static
verifiers that understand JML.
