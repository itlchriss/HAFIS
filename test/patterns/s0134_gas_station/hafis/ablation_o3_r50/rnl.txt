(8s elapsed)Thinking... (8s elapsed)Thinking... (8s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `cost`.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `gas` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `gas` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `cost` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -1 and is less than the length of the integer array parameter `gas`.  
- If the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to [1,2,3,4,5] and the integer array parameter `cost` is equal to [3,4,5,1,2], the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the integer array parameter `gas` is equal to [2,3,4] and the integer array parameter `cost` is equal to [3,4,3], the integer result is equal to -1.  
- If the integer result is greater than or equal to 0, the integer result is the only index between 0 and the difference between the length of the integer array parameter `gas` and 1 that allows completing one full circuit using the integer array parameters `gas` and `cost`.
