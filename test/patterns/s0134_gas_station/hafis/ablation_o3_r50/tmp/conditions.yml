ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
- If the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 , the type_integer_ result is the only index between 0 and the difference between the type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length and 1 that allows completing 1 full circuit using the type_integer_array_ param_gas_and the type_string_ strs_a.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
