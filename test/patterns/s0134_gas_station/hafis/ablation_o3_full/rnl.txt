(10s elapsed)- If 'int[]' `gas` and 'int[]' `cost` permit exactly one starting station from which the entire circular route can be completed in clockwise order then 'int' result equals the index of that unique starting station  
- If 'int[]' `gas` and 'int[]' `cost` do not permit completing the circular route from any station then 'int' result equals -1
