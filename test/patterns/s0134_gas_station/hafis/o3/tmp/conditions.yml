ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 1 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1 , the type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s summation is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s summation.
- If the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 , starting from the index equal to the type_integer_ result and moving clockwise , the running total of the difference between each value in the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ and the corresponding value in the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is never negative and the traversal returns to the starting index.
- If the type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 , no other index in the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ satisfies the previous specification.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_gas_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_cost_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to negative 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s length.
- The type_integer_array_ param_gas_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_cost_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
