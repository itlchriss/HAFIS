Based on the given software specification and following the established pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is even.
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 2 and is less than or equal to 20000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -10000 and are less than or equal to 10000.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -10000 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,4,3,2], the integer result is equal to 4.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [6,2,6,5,1,2], the integer result is equal to 9.
