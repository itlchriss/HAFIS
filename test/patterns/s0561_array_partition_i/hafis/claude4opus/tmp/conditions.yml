ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000 and is less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 9.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is even.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 2 and is less_than_or_equal to 20000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
