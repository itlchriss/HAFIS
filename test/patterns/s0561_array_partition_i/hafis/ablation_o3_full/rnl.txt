(10s elapsed)- int[] `nums` must contain an even positive number of elements  
- each value in int[] `nums` must be within the inclusive range -10000 to 10000  
- result of type int equals the maximum obtainable total of the smaller member from every pair when all elements of int[] `nums` are grouped into n non-overlapping pairs
