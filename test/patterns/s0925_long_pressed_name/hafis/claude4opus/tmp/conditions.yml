ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , The type_string_ param_name_'s values are contained by the type_string_ param_typed_ in the same order.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_typed_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_name_'s length.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_typed_ does not contain All values from the type_string_ param_name_ in the same order or the count of character in the type_string_ param_typed_ is less_than to the count of the same character in the type_string_ param_name_.
- If the type_string_ param_name_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_typed_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_name_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_typed_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_name_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000.
- The type_string_ param_typed_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000.
- The type_string_ param_name_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_typed_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
