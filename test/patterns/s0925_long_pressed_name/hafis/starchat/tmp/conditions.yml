- The type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a if it is possible that it was the friends name , with characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

- If the type_string_ param_name_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_typed_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is the type_string_ strs_a.
