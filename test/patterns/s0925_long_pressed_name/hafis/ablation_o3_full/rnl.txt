(9s elapsed)- When every contiguous run of the same character in data type String 'typed' appears in the identical order as in data type String 'name' and the size of each run in 'typed' is at least the size of the corresponding run in 'name' result boolean is true  
- If any character of data type String 'name' is absent from data type String 'typed' or appears out of order result boolean is false  
- If the length of data type String 'typed' is less than the length of data type String 'name' result boolean is false  
- When data type String 'typed' is exactly equal to data type String 'name' result boolean is true
