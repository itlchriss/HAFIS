ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_typed_ contains of the type_string_ param_name_ in the same order and each contiguous repetition of in the type_string_ param_typed_'s length that is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is greater_than_or_equal to the length of the corresponding contiguous repetition in the type_string_ param_name_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_typed_ does not satisfy the ordering or repetition condition described for the true literal with respect to the type_string_ param_name_.
- If the type_string_ param_name_ is equal to the literal stry_a and the type_string_ param_typed_ is equal to the literal stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_name_ is equal to the literal stry_a and the type_string_ param_typed_ is equal to the literal stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_typed_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_name_ only contains English lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_typed_ only contains English lowercase_alphabets.
