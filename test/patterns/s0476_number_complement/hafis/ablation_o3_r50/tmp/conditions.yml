ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to 2147483648.
- For every bit position set to 1 in the type_integer_ param_num_ the corresponding bit position is set to 0 in the integer result.
- For every bit position set to 0 in the type_integer_ param_num_ that is not more significant than its most significant 1 bit the corresponding bit position is set to 1 in the integer result.
- No bit position more significant than the most significant 1 bit of the type_integer_ param_num_ is set to 1 in the integer result.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 5 the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 1 the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
