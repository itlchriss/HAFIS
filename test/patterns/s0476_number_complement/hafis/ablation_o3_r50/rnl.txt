- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than 2147483648  
- For every bit position set to 1 in the integer parameter `num` the corresponding bit position is set to 0 in the integer result  
- For every bit position set to 0 in the integer parameter `num` that is not more significant than its most significant 1 bit the corresponding bit position is set to 1 in the integer result  
- No bit position more significant than the most significant 1 bit of the integer parameter `num` is set to 1 in the integer result  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 5 the integer result is equal to 2  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 1 the integer result is equal to 0
