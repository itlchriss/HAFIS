ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 5 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- The sum of the type_integer_ param_num_ and the type_integer_ result is equal to 2 raised to the power of the number of bits in the binary representation of the type_integer_ param_num_ - 1.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_num_ is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than to 2147483648.
