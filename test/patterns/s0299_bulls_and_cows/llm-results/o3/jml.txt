(i.e. input constraints, definition of bulls, definition of cows and of the
returned string).

Explanation of the main clauses

1. Pre-conditions enforce the bounds on the string lengths and that both
   parameters are made of decimal digits only.

2. `bulls` is specified as the sum over all indices where the two characters
   coincide.

3. To specify `cows`, we first count, for each digit `d ∈ {0,…,9}`,
   how many times it occurs in `secret` and in `guess` (`count`);  
   the smaller of the two numbers is the amount that can be “matched”.  
   Summing these minima over the ten digits gives all matches, from which
   the already-counted bulls are subtracted.  

   (A small helper model function `min` is introduced because JML lacks a
   built-in minimum operator.)

4. The result must equal `"bullsA" + "cowsB"` exactly.

5. `assignable \nothing` together with `pure` states that the method has no
   observable side effects.
