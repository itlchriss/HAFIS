(14s elapsed)- Requires String `secret` and String `guess` have equal length  
- Requires length of String `secret` is at least 1 and at most 1000  
- Requires length of String `guess` is at least 1 and at most 1000  
- Requires every character in String `secret` is a digit from 0 to 9  
- Requires every character in String `guess` is a digit from 0 to 9  
- Ensures String result is formatted as one or more decimal digits followed by the character A followed by one or more decimal digits followed by the character B  
- Ensures the integer value of the substring of result that precedes the character A equals the number of positions i where the character at index i of String `secret` equals the character at index i of String `guess`  
- Ensures the integer value of the substring of result that occurs between the characters A and B equals the count of characters from String `guess` that are not bulls yet occur in String `secret` at a different index with multiplicity taken into account
