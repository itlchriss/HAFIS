ensures:
- The type_string_ result is in the format stry_a , that x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_secret_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_secret_ contains digits only and the type_string_ param_guess_ contains digits only.
- The type_string_ param_secret_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and the type_string_ param_guess_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
