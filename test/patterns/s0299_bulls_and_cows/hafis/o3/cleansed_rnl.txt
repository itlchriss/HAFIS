- The length of the string parameter `guess` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 1000.
- The length of the string parameter `secret` is equal to the length of the string parameter `guess`.
- The string parameter `secret` consists only of digit characters.
- The string parameter `guess` consists only of digit characters.
- The string result is composed of the decimal representation of a non-negative integer, followed by the uppercase letter A, followed by the decimal representation of a non-negative integer, followed by the uppercase letter B.
- The non-negative integer represented by the characters that appear before the uppercase letter A in the string result is equal to the number of indices i such that the character at index i of the string parameter `secret` is equal to the character at index i of the string parameter `guess`.
- The non-negative integer represented by the characters that appear between the uppercase letter A and the uppercase letter B in the string result is equal to the number of digit occurrences that are present in both the string parameter `secret` and the string parameter `guess`, excluding the digits counted as bulls, with each digit counted at most as many times as it appears outside of bull positions in both strings.
- The sum between the integer value that appears before the uppercase letter A in the string result and the integer value that appears between the uppercase letter A and the uppercase letter B in the string result is less than or equal to the length of the string parameter `secret`.
- If the string parameter `secret` is equal to "1807" and the string parameter `guess` is equal to "7810", the string result is equal to "1A3B".
- If the string parameter `secret` is equal to "1123" and the string parameter `guess` is equal to "0111", the string result is equal to "1A1B".
- If the string parameter `secret` is equal to "1" and the string parameter `guess` is equal to "0", the string result is equal to "0A0B".
- If the string parameter `secret` is equal to "1" and the string parameter `guess` is equal to "1", the string result is equal to "1A0B".
