- The type_string_ result is formatted as stry_a that x is the number of bulls and y is the number of cows.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
- If the type_string_ param_secret_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_guess_ is equal to stry_b , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_c.
requires:
