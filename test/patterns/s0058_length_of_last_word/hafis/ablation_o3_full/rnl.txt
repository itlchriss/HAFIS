(8s elapsed)- int result equals the count of consecutive non-space characters occurring at the end of String parameter `s`  
- String parameter `s` may contain one or more trailing space characters and such trailing space characters do not contribute to int result  
- if String parameter `s` contains exactly one word without any space characters, int result equals the total length of String parameter `s`
