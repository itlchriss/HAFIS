- The string parameter `s` consists of only English letters and space characters.  
- The string parameter `s` contains at least one English letter.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to the length of the string parameter `s`.  
- If the string parameter `s` contains no space character, the integer result is equal to the length of the string parameter `s`.  
- If the last character of the string parameter `s` is equal to the space character literal, the integer result is equal to the length of the last word in the string parameter `s`.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "Hello World", the integer result is equal to 5.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to " fly me to the moon ", the integer result is equal to 4.
