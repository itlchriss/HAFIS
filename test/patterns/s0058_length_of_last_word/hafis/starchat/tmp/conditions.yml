ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to strz_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 6.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
- The type_string_ param_s_ will have at least 1 word.
