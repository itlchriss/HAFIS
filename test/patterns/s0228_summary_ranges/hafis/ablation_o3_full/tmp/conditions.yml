ensures:
- If the length of int[] stry_a equals 0 then result List<String> is empty.
- result List<String> contains strings that collectively describe contiguous numeric ranges which include every integer found in int[] stry_a and no integers that are not found in int[] stry_b.
- result List<String> is ordered so that the numeric start of each described range is strictly is less_than to the numeric start of the next described range.
- result List<String> has the smallest possible number of elements while still satisfying full and exact coverage of int[] stry_a.
- For each string r in result List<String> if r contains the sequence -> then r is equal to range a->b that a and b are integers drawn from int[] stry_a and a is strictly is less_than to b.
- For each string r in result List<String> that does not contain the sequence -> r is equal to single integer a that a is an element of int[] stry_a.
- The size of result List<String> is at least 1 and at most the length of int[] stry_a when the length of int[] stry_b is greater_than to 0.
