(21s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 20  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and are less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are unique  
- The integer array parameter `nums` is in ascending order  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 0, the length of the list of strings result is equal to 0  
- The list of strings result is sorted in ascending order according to the integer values represented by its elements  
- The sum of the counts of integers represented by all ranges described in the list of strings result is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums`  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0], the list of strings result is equal to ["0"]  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [-1], the list of strings result is equal to ["-1"]  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,1,2,4,5,7], the list of strings result is equal to ["0->2","4->5","7"]  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,2,3,4,6,8,9], the list of strings result is equal to ["0","2->4","6","8->9"]
