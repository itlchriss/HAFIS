ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , there exists an integer value k such that the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to the product between k and k.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , for all integer values k the type_integer_ param_num_ is not_equal to the product between k and k.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 14 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
