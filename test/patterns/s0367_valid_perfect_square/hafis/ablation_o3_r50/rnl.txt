- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, there exists an integer value k such that the integer parameter `num` is equal to the product between k and k.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, for all integer values k the integer parameter `num` is not equal to the product between k and k.  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 16, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 14, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
