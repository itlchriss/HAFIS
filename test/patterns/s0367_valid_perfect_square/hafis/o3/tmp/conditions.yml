ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to the product between an integer value and the same integer value.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_ param_num_ is not_equal to the product between any integer value and the same integer value.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_num_ is equal to 14 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
