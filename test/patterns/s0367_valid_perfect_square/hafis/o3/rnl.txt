(14s elapsed)- The integer parameter `num` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer parameter `num` is equal to the product between an integer value and the same integer value.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer parameter `num` is not equal to the product between any integer value and the same integer value.  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 16, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 14, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
