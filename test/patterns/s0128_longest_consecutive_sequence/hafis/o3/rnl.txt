(6s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 0, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [100,4,200,1,3,2], the integer result is equal to 4.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1], the integer result is equal to 9.
