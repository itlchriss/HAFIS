ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_s_ contains is less_than to 2 occurrences of the chry_a.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_s_ does not contain 3 or more consecutive occurrences of the chry_a.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_s_ contains 2 or more occurrences of the chry_a or the type_string_ param_s_ contains 3 or more consecutive occurrences of the chry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000.
- The type_string_ param_s_'s values are equal to the chry_a , the chry_b , or the chry_c.
