- All characters in the string parameter `s` are either the character literal 'A' or the character literal 'L' or the character literal 'P'.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the count of the character literal 'A' in the string parameter `s` is less than 2 and the string parameter `s` does not contain the substring literal "LLL".  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the count of the character literal 'A' in the string parameter `s` is greater than or equal to 2 or the string parameter `s` contains the substring literal "LLL".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "PPALLP", the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "PPALLL", the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
