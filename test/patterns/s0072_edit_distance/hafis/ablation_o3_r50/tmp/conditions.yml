ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 500 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_w1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_w2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_string_ param_w1_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_w2_ is equal to stry_b , the type_integer_ result is equal to 5.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_w2_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 500 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_w1_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_w2_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
