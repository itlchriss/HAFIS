(10s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `w1` is less than or equal to 500 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The length of the string parameter `w2` is less than or equal to 500 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The string parameter `w1` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The string parameter `w2` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to the sum between the length of the string parameter `w1` and the length of the string parameter `w2`.  
- The integer result is equal to the minimum number of single character insert operations or delete operations or replace operations required to transform the string parameter `w1` into the string parameter `w2`.  
- If the string parameter `w1` is equal to "horse" and the string parameter `w2` is equal to "ros", the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the string parameter `w1` is equal to "intention" and the string parameter `w2` is equal to "execution", the integer result is equal to 5.
