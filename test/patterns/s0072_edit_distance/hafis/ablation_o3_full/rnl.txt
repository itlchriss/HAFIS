(7s elapsed)- requires parameter `w1` of type String is not null and parameter `w2` of type String is not null  
- ensures result of type int equals the minimum count of single character insertions deletions or replacements needed to convert the value of parameter `w1` to the value of parameter `w2`  
- ensures result of type int is zero if and only if the value of parameter `w1` equals the value of parameter `w2`
