Explanation of the clauses

1. `\result.equals(Integer.toHexString(num))` directly captures the full mathematical meaning in one line; the rest merely expands it for formal tools that may not trust library code.
2. Additional `ensures` clauses spell out shape, character set, and leading-zero rules.
3. The unsigned equality guarantees the required two’s-complement behaviour for negative inputs.
4. The helper model methods (`unsignedValueOfHex`, `charToValue`, `pow16`) give a pure, mathematical definition of how the string is interpreted—no implementation is needed; they exist solely for specification and proof purposes.
