(10s elapsed)- If int `num` equals 0 then String result equals "0"  
- If int `num` is greater than 0 then String result is the lowercase base sixteen representation of int `num` and String result contains no leading character "0"  
- If int `num` is less than 0 then String result is the lowercase base sixteen representation of the thirty two bit twoâ€™s complement value of int `num` and String result contains no leading character "0"  
- For every int `num` the length of String result is at least 1 and at most 8 characters  
- For every int `num` every character in String result belongs to the set "0123456789abcdef"
