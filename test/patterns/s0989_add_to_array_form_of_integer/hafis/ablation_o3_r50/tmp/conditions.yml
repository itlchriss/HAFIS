ensures:
- The type_list_ result's values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 9.
- If the size of the type_list_ result is greater_than to 1 , the type_list_ result's first_element is not equal to 0.
- Interpreting the type_integer_array_ param_num_ as a left to right digit sequence produces an integer N and adding the type_integer_ param_k_ to N produces an integer M such that the type_list_ result contains the digits of M in left to right order.
- The size of the type_list_ result is equal to the number of digits of the integer obtained by adding the type_integer_ param_k_ to the integer represented by the type_integer_array_ param_num_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 34 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 181 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 806 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_num_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 9.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s length is greater_than to 1 , the type_integer_array_ param_num_'s first_element is not equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
