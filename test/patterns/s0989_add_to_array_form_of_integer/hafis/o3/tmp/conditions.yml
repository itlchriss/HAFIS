ensures:
- The type_list_ result's values are less_than_or_equal to 9 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_list_ result's length is greater_than to 1 , the type_list_ result's first_element is greater_than to 0.
- The integer value represented by the sequence of digits in the type_list_ result is equal to the sum between the integer value represented by the sequence of digits in the type_integer_array_ param_num_ and the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 34 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 181 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_num_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 806 , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
