ensures:
- List<Integer> result is the decimal digits in left to right order of the integer obtained by adding the integer represented by int[] the chry_a to int the chry_b.
- Each Integer element in List<Integer> result is greater_than to 0 and is less_than to 9 inclusive.
- List<Integer> result contains no leading zeros except when the computed sum equals 0 in which case List<Integer> result contains 1 element with value 0.
- The size of List<Integer> result equals the minimal number of digits needed to express the sum of the integer represented by int[] the chry_a and int the chry_b.
