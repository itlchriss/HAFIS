- List<Integer> result represents the decimal digits in left to right order of the integer obtained by adding the integer represented by int[] 'num' to int 'k'
- Each Integer element in List<Integer> result is between zero and nine inclusive
- List<Integer> result contains no leading zeros except when the computed sum equals zero in which case List<Integer> result contains exactly one element with value zero
- The size of List<Integer> result equals the minimal number of digits needed to express the sum of the integer represented by int[] 'num' and int 'k'
