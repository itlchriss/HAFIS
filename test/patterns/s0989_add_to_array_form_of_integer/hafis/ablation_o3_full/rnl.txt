(9s elapsed)- If int[] 'num' has length between one and ten thousand inclusive and every element of int[] 'num' is an integer from zero to nine inclusive and int 'k' is an integer from one to ten thousand inclusive then the method completes normally  
- List<Integer> result represents the decimal digits in left to right order of the integer obtained by adding the integer represented by int[] 'num' to int 'k'  
- Each Integer element in List<Integer> result is between zero and nine inclusive  
- List<Integer> result contains no leading zeros except when the computed sum equals zero in which case List<Integer> result contains exactly one element with value zero  
- The size of List<Integer> result equals the minimal number of digits needed to express the sum of the integer represented by int[] 'num' and int 'k'
