The Java code that really computes the result has been elided – the task here is
only to encode the original constraints and the required functional behaviour.  

```
public class AddToArrayForm {

      @         (\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < a.length;

Explanation of the relevant clauses

• `valueOf` is a pure model function that turns an array of digits into the
   corresponding mathematical (unbounded) integer.  It is defined with
   a summation (`\sum`) and the usual power function (`\pow`).

• The `requires` clauses directly encode every bullet of the
   “Constraints” section of the original statement.

• The `ensures` clauses encode
   – the syntactic properties that a correct array-form must have  
   – and, most importantly, the functional requirement that the integer
     represented by the returned array equals `valueOf(num) + k`.

With these annotations a static verifier can check any concrete Java
implementation of `addToArrayForm` against the given problem
specification.
