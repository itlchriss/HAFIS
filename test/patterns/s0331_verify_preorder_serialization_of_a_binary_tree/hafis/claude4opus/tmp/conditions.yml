ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to valid preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_preorder_ does not represent a valid preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_preorder_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_preorder_ contains integers in the range 0 to 100 and the chry_a characters separated by commas.
- The type_string_ param_preorder_ does not contain 2 consecutive commas.
- The type_string_ param_preorder_ does not contain empty values between commas.
