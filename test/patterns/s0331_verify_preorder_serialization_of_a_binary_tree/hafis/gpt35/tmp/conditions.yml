ensures:
- The type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal if the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_preorder_ is equal to strkk_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_preorder_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_string_ param_preorder_ contains integers in the range arr_a and the chry_a separated by commas ' , '.
