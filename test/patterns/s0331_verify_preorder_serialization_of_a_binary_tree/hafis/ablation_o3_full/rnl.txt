(9s elapsed)- Requires 'preorder' of type String is not null and its length is at least 1 and at most 10000 and every comma separated value in 'preorder' is either an integer in the range 0 to 100 or the character '#'

- If 'preorder' of type String represents a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree then result of type boolean is true

- If 'preorder' of type String does not represent a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree then result of type boolean is false
