    public static /*@ pure @*/ boolean isValidSerialization(String preorder)

that decides whether the comma–separated string preorder is a legal
pre-order serialization of a binary tree.  
Only the contract (no Java implementation) is given.

```java
public class PreorderChecker {

    /*@  requires preorder != null;
      @  // 1 ≤ |preorder| ≤ 10 000
      @  requires 1 <= preorder.length() && preorder.length() <= 10_000;
      @
      @  // The lexical form is guaranteed to be correct according to the
      @  // statement of the problem, but we record it anyway:
      @  //  – every character is a digit, ‘#’ or ‘,’
      @  //  – first and last characters are not ‘,’
      @  //  – there are no two consecutive commas.
      @  requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i < preorder.length();
      @                 preorder.charAt(i) == ',' ||
      @                 preorder.charAt(i) == '#' ||
      @                 Character.isDigit(preorder.charAt(i)));
      @  requires preorder.charAt(0) != ',' &&
      @           preorder.charAt(preorder.length() - 1) != ',';
      @  requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i < preorder.length() - 1;
      @                 !(preorder.charAt(i) == ',' &&
      @                   preorder.charAt(i + 1) == ','));

      @  /*  The result is true  IFF
      @      – while scanning the tokens from left to right the number of
      @        “slots” (open child positions) never becomes negative, and
      @      – when the last token is processed the number of slots is 0.
      @
      @      We formalise this with

Explanation of the main clauses:

1. Pre-conditions (`requires`)  
   – non-null string, length within the stated bounds;  
   – lexical validity of the input (only digits, ‘#’ and ‘,’; no
   leading, trailing or consecutive commas).  
   The original exercise said this validity is guaranteed, but it is
   still useful to record it explicitly.

2. Post-condition (`ensures`)  
   It encodes the well-known “slot counting” rule:
   start with one free child slot; every integer consumes one slot and
   creates two new ones (net +1), every ‘#’ only consumes a slot
   (net –1); the running number of slots must stay positive and end in
   zero.  
   The summations are expressed with JML’s `\sum` and Java’s pure
   `String.split` for tokenisation.

3. `assignable \nothing` states that the method has no side effects
   (it is purely functional).
