(11s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `s` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The string parameter `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -1 and is less than the length of the string parameter `s`.  
- If the integer result is equal to -1, every character in the string parameter `s` appears more than once in the string parameter `s`.  
- If the integer result is greater than or equal to 0, the character at the index given by the integer result in the string parameter `s` appears exactly once in the string parameter `s`.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "leetcode", the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "loveleetcode", the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "aabb", the integer result is equal to -1.
