Based on the specification, here's the JML (Java Modeling Language) specification for the function that counts the number of 1 bits:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires true;
      @ ensures \result >= 0 && \result <= 32;
      @ ensures \result == (\num_of int i; 0 <= i && i < 32; ((n >> i) & 1) == 1);
      @ assignable \nothing;
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int hammingWeight(int n) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Let me break down the JML specification:

1. **`public normal_behavior`**: Indicates this is a specification for normal (non-exceptional) behavior.

2. **`requires true`**: No preconditions - the function accepts any integer value.

3. **`ensures \result >= 0 && \result <= 32`**: The result must be between 0 and 32 inclusive (since we're counting bits in a 32-bit integer).

4. **`ensures \result == (\num_of int i; 0 <= i && i < 32; ((n >> i) & 1) == 1)`**: This is the key postcondition that counts the number of 1 bits:
   - `\num_of` is a JML quantifier that counts the number of values satisfying a condition
   - We iterate through bit positions 0 to 31
   - For each position `i`, we check if the bit at that position is 1 using `((n >> i) & 1) == 1`
   - The result equals the count of positions where the bit is 1

5. **`assignable \nothing`**: The method doesn't modify any fields (it's a pure function).

6. **`pure`**: Indicates the method has no side effects and can be used in specifications.

Alternative, more detailed specification with additional constraints:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires true;
      @ ensures \result >= 0 && \result <= 32;
      @ ensures \result == hammingWeightValue(n);
      @ assignable \nothing;
      @
      @ also
      @
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires n == 0;
      @ ensures \result == 0;
      @
      @ also
      @
      @ public normal_behavior
      @ requires n == -1; // All bits set (two's complement)
      @ ensures \result == 32;
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int hammingWeight(int n) {
        // Implementation here
    }
    
    /*@ public static model pure int hammingWeightValue(int n) {
      @   return (\num_of int i; 0 <= i && i < 32; ((n >> i) & 1) == 1);
      @ }
      @*/
}
```

This alternative version includes:
- A model method `hammingWeightValue` that encapsulates the counting logic
- Additional specific cases for `n == 0` (result should be 0) and `n == -1` (result should be 32)
