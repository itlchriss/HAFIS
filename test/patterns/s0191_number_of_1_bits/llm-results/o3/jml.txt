(7s elapsed)Below is a compact but complete JML specification (and minimal Java skeleton) for the “Number of 1 Bits” function.  
The specification is self-contained; you may paste it into any JML-aware tool (e.g. OpenJML) to type-check it.

```java
public final class HammingWeight {

    /**
     * Returns the number of bit positions that are set to 1 in the
     * two-complement representation of the 32-bit argument n.
     */
    /*@
      // 1.  No restrictions on the argument: every 32-bit value is allowed.
      requires true;

      // 2.  The method is side-effect free.
      assignable \nothing;

      // 3.  The result is always in the range 0 … 32.
      ensures   0 <= \result && \result <= 32;

      // 4.  Functional specification:  \result equals the number of 1-bits.
      ensures   \result ==
                 (\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < 32;
                     (((n >>> i) & 1) == 1 ? 1 : 0));

      // 5.  Pure: its value depends only on its arguments.
      public    pure;
    @*/
    public static int hammingWeight(int n) {
        /* implementation left to the developer */
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            n &= (n - 1);   // clears the least-significant 1-bit
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    private HammingWeight() { /* not instantiable */ }
}
```

Explanation of the JML clauses
1. `requires true;`  
   – Every possible `int` value is a valid argument.

2. `assignable \nothing;`  
   – The method does not modify any visible state.

3. `ensures 0 <= \result && \result <= 32;`  
   – A sanity bound derived from the bit-width.

4. `ensures \result == …`  
   – The formal definition of Hamming weight, expressed with JML’s
     summation quantifier: for each bit position `i` from 0 to 31
     add 1 if that bit is 1, else add 0.

5. `public pure;`  
   – Marks the method as mathematically pure (read-only, deterministic).
