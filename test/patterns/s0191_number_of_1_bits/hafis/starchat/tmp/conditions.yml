ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 32.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1011 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 10000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 11111111111111111111111111111101 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
