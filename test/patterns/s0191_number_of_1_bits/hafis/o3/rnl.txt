(11s elapsed)Thinking... (11s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is represented using exactly 32 bits.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 32.  
- The integer result is equal to the number of bits equal to 1 in the 32-bit binary representation of the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 11, the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 128, the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to -3, the integer result is equal to 31.
