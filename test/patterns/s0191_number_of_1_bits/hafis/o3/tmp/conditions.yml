ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 32.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the number of bits equal to 1 in the 32-bit binary representation of the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 11 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 128 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to negative 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31.
