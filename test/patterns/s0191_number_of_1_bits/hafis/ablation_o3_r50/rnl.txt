(10s elapsed)Thinking... (10s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is represented by a binary string of length 32.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 32.  
- The integer result is equal to the number of characters equal to the character '1' in the binary string representation of the integer parameter `n`.  
- If the binary string representation of the integer parameter `n` is equal to 00000000000000000000000000001011, the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the binary string representation of the integer parameter `n` is equal to 00000000000000000000000010000000, the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the binary string representation of the integer parameter `n` is equal to 11111111111111111111111111111101, the integer result is equal to 31.
