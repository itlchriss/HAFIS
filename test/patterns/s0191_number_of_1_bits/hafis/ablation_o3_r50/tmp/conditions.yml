ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 32.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the number of characters equal to the character the chry_a in the binary string_representation of the type_integer_ param_n_.
- If the binary string_representation of the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1011 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the binary string_representation of the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 10000000 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the binary string_representation of the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 11111111111111111111111111111101 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 31.
