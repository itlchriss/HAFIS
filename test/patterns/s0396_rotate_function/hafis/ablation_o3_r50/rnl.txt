(14s elapsed)Thinking... (15s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -100 and are less than or equal to 100.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to -2147483648 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum value among all rotation function values derived from the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [4,3,2,6], the integer result is equal to 26.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [100], the integer result is equal to 0.
