- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -100 and are less than or equal to 100.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum rotation function value obtained from all arrays produced by rotating the integer array parameter `nums` any number of positions clockwise.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [4,3,2,6], the integer result is equal to 26.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [100], the integer result is equal to 0.
