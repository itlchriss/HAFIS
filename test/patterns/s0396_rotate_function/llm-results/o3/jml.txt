It is written for a classical LeetCode‐like signature

    public static int maxRotateFunction(int[] nums)

and uses only standard JML operators (quantifiers, modulo, etc.).  
You can paste it verbatim above the method body.

```java
public class Solution {

    /*@  //  ───────────────────────────  PRECONDITIONS  ───────────────────────────
      @ 1. A (non-null) array is supplied whose length fits the problem limits.
      @ 2. Every element obeys the value range [-100, 100].
      @
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires 1 <= nums.length && nums.length <= 100_000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length;
      @                        -100 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 100);
      @
      @  //  ───────────────────────────  POSTCONDITIONS  ──────────────────────────
      @ 1.  result equals some rotation value
      @     F(k) = Σ_{i=0..n-1} ( i * nums[(i + k) mod n] ).
      @ 2.  result is the maximum of all such rotation values.
      @
      @ ensures (\exists int k; 0 <= k && k < nums.length;
      @            \result ==
      @              (\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length;
      @                    i * nums[(i + k) % nums.length]));

      @
      @  //  ───────────────────────────  FRAME CONDITION  ─────────────────────────

    public static int maxRotateFunction(int[] nums) {

    }
}
```

Explanation of the essential JML clauses:

• `requires` lines encode the input constraints given in the original problem.  
• The first `ensures` line states that the returned value equals one of the rotation-function values F(k).  
• The second `ensures` line states that this value is greater than or equal to every possible F(k), i.e. it is the maximum.  
• `assignable \nothing` marks the method as side-effect-free with respect to the program state visible to callers (only local/stack variables may change).
