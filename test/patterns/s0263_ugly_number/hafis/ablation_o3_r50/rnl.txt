(12s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to -2147483648 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 0, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0 and every prime factor of the integer parameter `n` is either 2 or 3 or 5, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0 and at least one prime factor of the integer parameter `n` is not 2 and is not 3 and is not 5, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 6, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 8, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 14, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
