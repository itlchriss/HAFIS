ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 and every prime factor of the type_integer_ param_n_ is 2 or 3 or the type_integer_ param_n_ is 5 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 and at least 1 prime factor of the type_integer_ param_n_ is not 2 and is not 3 and is not 5 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 6 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 8 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 14 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
