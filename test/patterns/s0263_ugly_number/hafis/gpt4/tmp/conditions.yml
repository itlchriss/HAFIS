ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 and the prime_factors of the type_integer_ param_n_ are equal to the type_integer_array_ _fixed_integer_sequence_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than to 0 or the type_integer_ param_n_ has prime_factors other than 2 , 3 , and 5.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 6 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 8 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 14 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
