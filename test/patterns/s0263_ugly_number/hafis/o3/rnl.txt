(20s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0 and all prime factors of the integer parameter `n` belong to the set 2 3 5.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 0 or at least one prime factor of the integer parameter `n` does not belong to the set 2 3 5.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 6, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 8, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 14, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
