- If int `n` equals 1 then boolean result is true  
- If int `n` is greater than 1 and every prime factor of int `n` belongs to the set 2 3 5 then boolean result is true  
- If int `n` is greater than 1 and int `n` contains any prime factor that does not belong to the set 2 3 5 then boolean result is false
