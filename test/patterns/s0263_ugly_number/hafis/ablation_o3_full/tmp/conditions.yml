ensures:
- If int the type_character_ chrs_a equals 1 then type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If int the type_character_ chrs_a is greater_than to 1 and every prime factor of int the type_character_ chrs_b belongs to the set 235 then type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If int the type_character_ chrs_a is greater_than to 1 and int the type_character_ chrs_b contains any prime factor that does not belong to the set 235 then type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
