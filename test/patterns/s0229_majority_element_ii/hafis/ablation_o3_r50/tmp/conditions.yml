ensures:
- For each integer value in the type_list_ result , the occurrence count of that integer value in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is greater_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length divided by 3.
- All integer values in the type_list_ result are contained in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- The size of the type_list_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
