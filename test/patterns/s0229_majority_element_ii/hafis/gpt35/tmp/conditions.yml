ensures:
- If the type_list_ result is not empty , all values in the type_list_ result are elements that are contained by more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result is equal to arr_b.
- The type_list_ result is unique.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 50000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
