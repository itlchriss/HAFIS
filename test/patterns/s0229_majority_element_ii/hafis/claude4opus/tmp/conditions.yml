ensures:
- The type_list_ result's values are contained by more than the quotient of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length divided by 3 times in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- The size of the type_list_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result contains 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result contains 1.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_list_ result contains 1 and 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 50000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000.
