ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal and the type_string_ param_pattern_ does not contain asterisk and does not contain questionmark , the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to the type_string_ param_pattern_.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal and the type_string_ param_pattern_ does not contain asterisk , the type_string_ param_inputString_'s length is equal to the type_string_ param_pattern_'s length.
requires:
