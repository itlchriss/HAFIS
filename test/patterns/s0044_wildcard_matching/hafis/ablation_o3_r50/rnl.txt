- The length of the string parameter `pattern` is less than or equal to 2000 and is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The string parameter `inputString` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The string parameter `pattern` consists of only lowercase English letters, the '?' character, and the '*' character.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the string parameter `pattern` matches the entire string parameter `inputString` when the '?' character represents any single character and the '*' character represents any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the string parameter `pattern` does not match the entire string parameter `inputString` when the '?' character represents any single character and the '*' character represents any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "aa" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "a", boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "aa" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "*", boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "cb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "?a", boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "adceb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "*a*b", boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "acdcb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "a*c?b", boolean result is equal to the false literal.
