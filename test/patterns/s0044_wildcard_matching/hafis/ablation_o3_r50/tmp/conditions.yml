ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_pattern_ matches the type_string_ param_inputString_ when the questionmark character is any single character and the asterisk character is any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_pattern_ does not match the type_string_ param_inputString_ when the questionmark character is any single character and the asterisk character is any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_pattern_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 2000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_string_ param_inputString_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_pattern_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ , and the asterisk character.
