ensures:
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_string_ param_pattern_ matches the type_string_ param_inputString_ under the rules that the character ? matches any single character and the character * matches any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_string_ param_pattern_ does not match the type_string_ param_inputString_ under the rules that the character ? matches any single character and the character * matches any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_pattern_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 2000.
- The type_string_ param_inputString_ only contains lowercase_alphabets.
- The type_string_ param_pattern_ only contains lowercase_alphabets or ? or *.
