(11s elapsed)Thinking... (11s elapsed)- The length of the string parameter `inputString` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2000.  
- The length of the string parameter `pattern` is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2000.  
- The string parameter `inputString` consists of only lowercase English letters.  
- The string parameter `pattern` consists of only lowercase English letters or the characters ? or *.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, the string parameter `pattern` matches the entire string parameter `inputString` under the rules that the character ? matches any single character and the character * matches any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, the string parameter `pattern` does not match the entire string parameter `inputString` under the rules that the character ? matches any single character and the character * matches any sequence of characters including the empty sequence.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "aa" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "a", the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "aa" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "*", the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "cb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "?a", the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "adceb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "*a*b", the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the string parameter `inputString` is equal to "acdcb" and the string parameter `pattern` is equal to "a*c?b", the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
