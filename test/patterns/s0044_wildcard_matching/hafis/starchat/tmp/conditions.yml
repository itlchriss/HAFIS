ensures:
- The type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal if the type_string_ strs_a matches the type_string_ strs_b.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_inputString_ is equal to stry_a and the type_string_ param_pattern_ is equal to stry_b , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
