(7s elapsed)Below is a pure‐specification (no implementation) of the problem written in JML for a Java method  

    public static /*@ pure @*/ int[] fairCandySwap(int[] aliceSizes,
                                                   int[] bobSizes)

You can copy-paste the annotation in front of the actual method header.

```java
/*@
  @ // ---------- PRECONDITIONS ----------
  @ requires aliceSizes != null && bobSizes != null;
  @
  @ // Length constraints
  @ requires 1 <= aliceSizes.length && aliceSizes.length <= 10000;
  @ requires 1 <= bobSizes.length  && bobSizes.length  <= 10000;
  @
  @ // Element value constraints
  @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < aliceSizes.length;
  @                     1 <= aliceSizes[i] && aliceSizes[i] <= 100000);
  @ requires (\forall int j; 0 <= j && j < bobSizes.length;
  @                     1 <= bobSizes[j] && bobSizes[j] <= 100000);
  @
  @ // Alice and Bob have different initial totals
  @ requires (\sum int i; 0 <= i && i < aliceSizes.length;  aliceSizes[i])
  @        != (\sum int j; 0 <= j && j < bobSizes.length; bobSizes[j]);
  @
  @ // ---------- POSTCONDITIONS ----------
  @ ensures \result != null && \result.length == 2;
  @
  @ // \result[0] must be a value appearing in aliceSizes
  @ ensures (\exists int i; 0 <= i && i < aliceSizes.length;
  @                    \result[0] == aliceSizes[i]);
  @
  @ // \result[1] must be a value appearing in bobSizes
  @ ensures (\exists int j; 0 <= j && j < bobSizes.length;
  @                    \result[1] == bobSizes[j]);
  @
  @ // After exchanging the two chosen boxes, totals are equal
  @ ensures (
  @     (\sum int k; 0 <= k && k < aliceSizes.length; aliceSizes[k])
  @       - \result[0] + \result[1]
  @   ==
  @     (\sum int k; 0 <= k && k < bobSizes.length;  bobSizes[k])
  @       - \result[1] + \result[0]
  @ );
  @*/
public static int[] fairCandySwap(int[] aliceSizes, int[] bobSizes) {
    // implementation goes here
}
```

Explanation of the clauses:

• The `requires` clauses encode all input constraints from the original statement (array sizes, element ranges, different totals).  
• The `ensures` clauses demand that:
  1. The returned array is non-null and of length two.  
  2. Its first component equals the size of some box Alice owns, and the second equals the size of some box Bob owns.  
  3. If Alice and Bob swap exactly those two boxes, their total numbers of candies become identical.

Any implementation that satisfies these JML conditions correctly solves LeetCode problem 888 “Fair Candy Swap.”
