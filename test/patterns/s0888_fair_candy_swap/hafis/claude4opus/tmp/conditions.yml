ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ result's first_element is contained in the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_.
- The second value of the type_integer_array_ result is contained in the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 10000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 100000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_'s summation is not_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_'s summation.
