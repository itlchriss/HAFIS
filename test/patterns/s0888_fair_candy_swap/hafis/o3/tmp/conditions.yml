ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to 2.
- The type_integer_array_ result's first_element is contained in the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_.
- The type_integer_array_ result's second_element is contained in the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_.
- The sum of the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ - the type_integer_array_ result's first_element + the type_integer_array_ result's second_element is equal to the sum of the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ - the type_integer_array_ result's second_element + the type_integer_array_ result's first_element .
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are greater_than_or_equal to 1 and are less_than_or_equal to 100000.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_aliceSizes_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_bobSizes_ is equal to arr_b , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_c.
