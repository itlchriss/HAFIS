(19s elapsed)Thinking... (19s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `bobSizes` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 10000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `bobSizes` are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.  
- The sum of the values in the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` is not equal to the sum of the values in the integer array parameter `bobSizes`.  
- The integer array result has a length that is equal to 2.  
- All values in the integer array result are greater than or equal to 1 and are less than or equal to 100000.  
- The first element of the integer array result is an element of the integer array parameter `aliceSizes`.  
- The second element of the integer array result is an element of the integer array parameter `bobSizes`.  
- The sum of the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` minus the first element of the integer array result plus the second element of the integer array result is equal to the sum of the integer array parameter `bobSizes` minus the second element of the integer array result plus the first element of the integer array result.  
- If the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` is equal to [1,1] and the integer array parameter `bobSizes` is equal to [2,2], the integer array result is equal to [1,2].  
- If the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` is equal to [1,2] and the integer array parameter `bobSizes` is equal to [2,3], the integer array result is equal to [1,2].  
- If the integer array parameter `aliceSizes` is equal to [2] and the integer array parameter `bobSizes` is equal to [1,3], the integer array result is equal to [2,3].
