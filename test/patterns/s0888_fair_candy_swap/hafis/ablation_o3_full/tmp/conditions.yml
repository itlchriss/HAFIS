ensures:
- result int[] must contain 2 elements.
- The first_element of result int[] is equal to value that occurs in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a.
- The second_element of result int[] is equal to value that occurs in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a.
- After execution the summation in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a - the first_element of result int[] + the second_element of result int[] equals the summation in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_b - the second_element of result int[] + the first_element of result int[].
- For every input that meets the prerequisites at least 1 result int[] meeting these behavioural specifications is guaranteed to exist.
requires:
- Every value in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a is at least 1 and at most 100000.
- Every value in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a is at least 1 and at most 100000.
- The summation in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_a must differ from the summation in param_int_[] the type_string_ strs_b.
