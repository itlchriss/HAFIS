(14s elapsed)- Parameter int[] `aliceSizes` must contain no fewer than 1 element and no more than 10^4 elements  
- Every value in parameter int[] `aliceSizes` must be at least 1 and at most 10^5  
- Parameter int[] `bobSizes` must contain no fewer than 1 element and no more than 10^4 elements  
- Every value in parameter int[] `bobSizes` must be at least 1 and at most 10^5  
- The sum of all values in parameter int[] `aliceSizes` must differ from the sum of all values in parameter int[] `bobSizes`  
- result int[] must contain exactly two elements  
- The first element of result int[] must be a value that occurs in parameter int[] `aliceSizes`  
- The second element of result int[] must be a value that occurs in parameter int[] `bobSizes`  
- After execution the sum of all values in parameter int[] `aliceSizes` minus the first element of result int[] plus the second element of result int[] equals the sum of all values in parameter int[] `bobSizes` minus the second element of result int[] plus the first element of result int[]  
- For every input that meets the prerequisites at least one result int[] meeting these behavioural specifications is guaranteed to exist
