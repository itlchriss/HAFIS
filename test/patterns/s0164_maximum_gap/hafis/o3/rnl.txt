(9s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than 2, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [10], the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [3,6,9,1], the integer result is equal to 3.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum difference between successive elements in the ascending order of the integer array parameter `nums`.
