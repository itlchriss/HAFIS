(10s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All the values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 1, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum difference between two successive elements in the sorted order of the integer array parameter `nums`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [3,6,9,1], the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [10], the integer result is equal to 0.
