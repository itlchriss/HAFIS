ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the maximum difference between 2 successive elements in the sorted order of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to 0.
