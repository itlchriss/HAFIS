Based on the given software specification and following the pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- If the length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than 2, the integer result is equal to 0.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 1000000000.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [3,6,9,1], the integer result is equal to 3.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [10], the integer result is equal to 0.
