Explanation of the contract

1. Preconditions  
   • The array is non-null, its length ∈ [1, 100 000], and each element is in the
     range [0, 1 000 000 000].  
2. Assignable clause  
   • `assignable \nothing` states that the method does not mutate any
     pre-existing memory; the input array `nums` therefore remains unchanged.  
3. Postconditions  
   • If the array has fewer than two elements, the result is 0.  
   • Otherwise, there exists an array `s` that  
     – is a permutation of `nums`,  
     – is sorted in non-decreasing order, and  
     – the returned value equals  
       `max_{1 ≤ k < s.length} (s[k] – s[k-1])`, expressed with JML’s `\max`
       quantifier.  
4. Helper predicate  
   • `isSortedPermutation` is a pure model method that formally captures
     “`b` is a non-decreasing permutation of `a`”.  It is only used in the
     specification; its Java body is never executed.

The functional requirement (“return the maximum adjacent difference in the
sorted order of the array”) is now fully captured by the JML annotations; the
time- and space-complexity requirements belong to the implementation and
therefore are left as informal comments.
