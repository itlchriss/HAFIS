- All characters in the string result are either the minus sign or one of the digits 0 1 2 3 4 5 6.  
- The integer value obtained by interpreting the string result as a base seven number is equal to the integer parameter `num`.  
- The string result does not start with the character 0 unless the string result is equal to "0".  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to 100, the string result is equal to "202".  
- If the integer parameter `num` is equal to -7, the string result is equal to "-10".
