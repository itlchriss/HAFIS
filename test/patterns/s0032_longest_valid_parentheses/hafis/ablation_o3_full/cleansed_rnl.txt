- If the String `s` has length zero then int result equals zero
- The int result denotes the maximum length of a contiguous substring of the String `s` that forms a well formed sequence of opening and closing brackets
- The int result is never negative
- The int result is never greater than the length of the String `s`
- The int result equals zero when the String `s` contains no well formed bracket substring
- The int result equals the length of the String `s` when the entire String `s` is a well formed bracket sequence
