ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is empty , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_integer_ result is greater_than to 0 , the type_integer_ result is even.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length , the type_string_ param_s_ forms a valid parentheses sequence.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to 30000.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
