ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 4.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to the empty string literal , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains left parenthesis and right parenthesis characters.
