Explanation of the essential JML clauses:

1. Preconditions (`requires`):
   • `s` is non-null.  
   • Its length lies between 0 and 30 000, inclusive.  
   • Every character is either '(' or ')'.

2. Auxiliary pure method `isValidParentheses`:
   Supplies a precise mathematical definition of a *well-formed* substring,
   expressed by:
   • A global balance of zero (`sum (…) == 0`).  
   • Every prefix has non-negative balance.

3. Post-conditions for `longestValidParentheses`:
   • The returned value is a legal length.  
   • There exists at least one valid substring whose length equals the
     returned value.  
   • No valid substring is longer than the returned value.

Together, these annotations are a faithful JML formalisation of the original
LeetCode specification.
