(11s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer parameter `n` mod 4 is not equal to 0.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer parameter `n` mod 4 is equal to 0.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 4, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 2, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
