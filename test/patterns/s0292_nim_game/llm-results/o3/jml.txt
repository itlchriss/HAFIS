    public boolean canWinNim(int n)

that must satisfy the problem statement.  
The logical fact that the first player wins iff n mod 4 ≠ 0 is captured
directly in the post-condition.  Hence the “both players play optimally”
part of the prose is reduced to that arithmetic property.

```java
public class Nim {

/*@  // 292. Nim Game
  @  public normal_behavior
  @    // 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^31 − 1
  @    requires 1 <= n && n <= Integer.MAX_VALUE;
  @
  @    // The first player can win  ⇔  n mod 4 ≠ 0
  @    ensures  \result == ((n % 4) != 0);
  @
  @    // The method is pure (no visible state change)
  @    assignable \nothing;
  @*/
  /*@ pure @*/                  // also marks the method as side-effect-free
  public boolean canWinNim(int n) {
      return (n & 3) != 0;      // one admissible implementation
  }
}
```

Explanation of the JML clauses:

• `requires` Encodes the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2³¹ − 1.  
• `ensures` States the observable behavior: the result is true exactly when n mod 4 ≠ 0.  
• `assignable \nothing` (together with the `/*@ pure @*/` modifier) guarantees that the method produces no side effects; it merely returns a value computed from its argument.
