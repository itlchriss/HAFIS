(12s elapsed)- The integer parameter `n` is greater than or equal to -2147483648 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.  
- The boolean result is true if and only if the integer parameter `n` is greater than 0 and the integer parameter `n` is equal to 2 raised to an integer exponent.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 1, the boolean result is true.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 16, the boolean result is true.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 3, the boolean result is false.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 4, the boolean result is true.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 5, the boolean result is false.  
- If the integer parameter `n` is less than or equal to 0, the boolean result is false.
