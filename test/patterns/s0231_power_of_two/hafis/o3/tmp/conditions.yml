ensures:
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is less_than_or_equal to 0 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 and the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 2 raised to an integer exponent.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal and the type_integer_ param_n_ is greater_than to 0 , the type_integer_ param_n_ is not equal to any power of 2.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 1 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 16 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 3 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 4 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_ param_n_ is equal to 5 , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
