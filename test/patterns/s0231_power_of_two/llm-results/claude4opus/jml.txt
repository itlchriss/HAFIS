Here's the JML specification for the "Power of Two" problem:

```java
public class PowerOfTwo {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires true;
      @ ensures \result == (\exists int x; 0 <= x && x <= 30; n == Math.pow(2, x));
      @ ensures \result == (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0);
      @ ensures n == 1 ==> \result == true;
      @ ensures n == 16 ==> \result == true;
      @ ensures n == 3 ==> \result == false;
      @ ensures n == 4 ==> \result == true;
      @ ensures n == 5 ==> \result == false;
      @ ensures n <= 0 ==> \result == false;
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Alternative, more detailed specification:

```java
public class PowerOfTwo {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires true;
      @ ensures \result <==> isPowerOfTwoProperty(n);
      @
      @ // Define helper predicate for clarity
      @ public static model pure boolean isPowerOfTwoProperty(int n) {
      @     return n > 0 && (\exists int x; 0 <= x && x <= 30; n == (1 << x));
      @ }
      @*/
    /*@ 
      @ // Alternative postconditions (all equivalent)
      @ ensures \result == (n > 0 && (n & (n - 1)) == 0);
      @ ensures \result == (n > 0 && Integer.bitCount(n) == 1);
      @
      @ // Specific test cases from examples
      @ ensures n == 1 ==> \result == true;   // 2^0 = 1
      @ ensures n == 16 ==> \result == true;  // 2^4 = 16
      @ ensures n == 3 ==> \result == false;
      @ ensures n == 4 ==> \result == true;   // 2^2 = 4
      @ ensures n == 5 ==> \result == false;
      @
      @ // Edge cases
      @ ensures n <= 0 ==> \result == false;
      @ ensures n == Integer.MAX_VALUE ==> \result == false; // 2^31 - 1 is not a power of 2
      @ ensures n == (1 << 30) ==> \result == true; // 2^30 is the largest power of 2 in int range
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // Implementation here
    }
    
    /*@ // Lemma: relationship between consecutive powers of two
      @ public invariant (\forall int k; 0 <= k && k < 30; 
      @     isPowerOfTwoProperty(1 << k) && 
      @     !isPowerOfTwoProperty((1 << k) + 1) &&
      @     isPowerOfTwoProperty(1 << (k + 1)));
      @*/
}
```

Key aspects of this JML specification:

1. **Main postcondition**: The result is true if and only if there exists an integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ 30) such that n = 2^x. The upper bound of 30 is because 2^31 would overflow the int type.

2. **Bit manipulation postcondition**: `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` is a well-known bit manipulation trick that checks if n is a power of two. This works because powers of two have exactly one bit set in their binary representation.

3. **Test cases**: All the examples from the problem are included as postconditions to ensure the implementation handles these specific cases correctly.

4. **Edge cases**: 
   - Negative numbers and zero cannot be powers of two
   - The largest power of two that fits in an int is 2^30 = 1,073,741,824

5. **Pure method**: The method is marked as `pure` since it has no side effects and only depends on its input parameter.

The specification allows for multiple implementation strategies, including the bit manipulation approach mentioned in the "follow up" question.
