The above problem description is already clear enough, but here's another way to understand it using JML notation:

```java
/**
 * Determines whether a given number {@code n} is a happy number according to the specified rules.
 * @param n The input number to check.
 * @return True if {@code n} is a happy number; False otherwise.
 */
public boolean isHappy(int n) {
    // Your implementation goes here...
}
```
