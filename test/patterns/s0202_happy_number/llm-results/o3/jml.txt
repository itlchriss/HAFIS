Explanation of the clauses

1. Preconditions (`requires`) reproduce the stated input constraint  
   `1 <= n <= 2^31 − 1`.

2. `assignable \nothing` says the routine is side-effect free.

3. The post-condition (`ensures`) ties the return value to the
   abstract, mathematical predicate `happy(n)` introduced just above.

4. `happy`, in turn, is defined by quantification over the iterative
   sequence `iter`, which is itself defined axiomatically by
   the two equations shown in the specification of `iter`.

In this way the informal description (“repeat the sum-of-squares of digits
until either reaching 1 or falling into a non-1 cycle”) is translated into
a precise JML contract that any implementation of
`isHappy` must satisfy.
