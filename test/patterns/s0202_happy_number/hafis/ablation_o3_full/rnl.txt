(11s elapsed)- int 'n' must be at least 1 and at most 2147483647 before the method is invoked  
- boolean result is true when repeatedly replacing the current value of int 'n' by the sum of the squares of its decimal digits eventually produces the value 1  
- boolean result is false when the described replacement process enters a recurring cycle that never produces the value 1
