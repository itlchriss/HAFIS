- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, repeatedly replacing the integer parameter `n` by the sum of the squares of its digits eventually produces the integer value 1.
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, repeatedly replacing the integer parameter `n` by the sum of the squares of its digits eventually produces an integer value that has appeared earlier in the sequence and the integer value 1 is never produced.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 19, the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
- If the integer parameter `n` is equal to 2, the boolean result is equal to the false literal.
