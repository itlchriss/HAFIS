ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- For every index i that is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length , the integer value at index i of the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the product of all integer values in the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ except the value at index i.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648 and are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 30 and are less_than_or_equal to 30.
