ensures:
- The type_integer_array_ result's length is equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length.
- For each index i from 0 to the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length - 1 the value at index i of the type_integer_array_ result is equal to the product of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values except the value at index i of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_.
- The type_integer_array_ result's values are less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_array_ result is equal to arr_b.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 30 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 30.
- The product of every prefix of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- The product of every suffix of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
