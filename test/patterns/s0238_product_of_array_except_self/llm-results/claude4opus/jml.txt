Here's the JML specification for the "Product of Array Except Self" problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires nums.length >= 2;
      @ requires nums.length <= 100000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; -30 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 30);
      @ ensures \result != null;
      @ ensures \result.length == nums.length;
      @ ensures (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @     \result[i] == (\product int j; 0 <= j && j < nums.length && j != i; nums[j]));
      @ ensures \fresh(\result);
      @ assignable \nothing;
      @ also
      @ public exceptional_behavior
      @ requires nums == null;
      @ signals_only NullPointerException;
      @*/
    public /*@ pure @*/ int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Key points in this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums` must not be null
   - Array length must be between 2 and 10^5
   - Each element must be between -30 and 30

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - Result array is not null
   - Result array has the same length as input array
   - Each element `result[i]` equals the product of all elements except `nums[i]`
   - Result is a fresh array (newly allocated)

3. **Frame condition (`assignable`):**
   - `\nothing` indicates the method doesn't modify any existing objects

4. **Exceptional behavior:**
   - Throws `NullPointerException` if input is null

5. **Method purity:**
   - Marked as `pure` since it doesn't modify any existing state

The `\product` quantifier computes the product of all elements satisfying the given condition. The condition `j != i` ensures we exclude the element at index `i` from the product.

Note: The constraint about products fitting in 32-bit integers is implicitly satisfied by using `int` type in Java, which is 32-bit. The O(n) time complexity requirement is an implementation detail that cannot be directly expressed in JML.
