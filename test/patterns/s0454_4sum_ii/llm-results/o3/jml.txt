Explanation of the main JML clauses

1. `requires …`  
   • Non-null arrays.  
   • All arrays have the same length `n`.  
   • 1 ≤ n ≤ 200.  
   • Every element lies in the range [−2²⁸, 2²⁸].

2. `assignable \nothing` (and the `pure` keyword)  
   The method must not modify any heap-allocated data or perform I/O.

3. `ensures …`  
   The nested `\sum` quantifiers count how many index quadruples `(i,j,k,l)` in
   `[0,n−1]⁴` satisfy  
   `nums1[i] + nums2[j] + nums3[k] + nums4[l] == 0`;  
   the result returned by the method must equal that count.

This contract is executable by common JML tools (OpenJML, KeY, etc.) and is a faithful formalisation of the original problem statement.
