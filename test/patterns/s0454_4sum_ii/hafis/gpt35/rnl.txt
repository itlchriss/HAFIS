- The length of each integer array parameter `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` is equal to `n` and is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 200.
- All the values in each integer array parameter `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` are greater than or equal to -2^28 and less than or equal to 2^28.
- The integer result is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer and is greater than or equal to the minimum value of java integer.
- If the integer result is equal to 2, the tuples are (0, 0, 0, 1) and (1, 1, 0, 0) where the sum of elements at the corresponding indices in `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` is equal to 0.
- If the integer result is equal to 1, there is one tuple where the sum of elements at the corresponding indices in `nums1`, `nums2`, `nums3`, and `nums4` is equal to 0.
