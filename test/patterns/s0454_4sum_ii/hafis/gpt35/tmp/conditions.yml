ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 2 , the tuples are tuple_a and tuple_b that the sum of elements at the corresponding indices in the type_string_ strs_a , the type_string_ strs_b , the type_string_ strs_c , and the type_string_ strs_d is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 1 , there exists 1 tuple that the sum of elements at the corresponding indices in the type_string_ strs_a , the type_string_ strs_b , the type_string_ strs_c , and the type_string_ strs_d is equal to 0.
