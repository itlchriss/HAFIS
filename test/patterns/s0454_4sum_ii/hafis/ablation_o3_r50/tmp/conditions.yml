ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_'s length multiplied by the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_'s length multiplied by the type_integer_array_ param_nums3_'s length multiplied by the type_integer_array_ param_nums4_'s length.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b and the type_integer_array_ param_nums3_ is equal to arr_c and the type_integer_array_ param_nums4_ is equal to arr_d , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ is equal to arr_b and the type_integer_array_ param_nums3_ is equal to arr_c and the type_integer_array_ param_nums4_ is equal to arr_d , the type_integer_ result is equal to 1.
- If the type_integer_ result is equal to 0 , the sum of 1 value from the type_integer_array_ param_nums1_ , 1 value from the type_integer_array_ param_nums2_ , 1 value from the type_integer_array_ param_nums3_ , and 1 value from the type_integer_array_ param_nums4_ is never equal to 0.
requires:
