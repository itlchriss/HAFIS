(16s elapsed)Thinking... (16s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is less than or equal to 200 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is less than or equal to 200 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums3` is less than or equal to 200 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums4` is less than or equal to 200 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums2` and is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums3` and is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums4`.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums3` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums4` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is less than or equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums1` multiplied by the length of the integer array parameter `nums2` multiplied by the length of the integer array parameter `nums3` multiplied by the length of the integer array parameter `nums4`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [1,2] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [-2,-1] and the integer array parameter `nums3` is equal to [-1,2] and the integer array parameter `nums4` is equal to [0,2], the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums3` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums4` is equal to [0], the integer result is equal to 1.  
- If the integer result is equal to 0, the sum of one value from the integer array parameter `nums1`, one value from the integer array parameter `nums2`, one value from the integer array parameter `nums3`, and one value from the integer array parameter `nums4` is never equal to 0.
