(21s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums2` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums3` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums4` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 200.  
- The length of the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums2` and is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums3` and is equal to the length of the integer array parameter `nums4`.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums1` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums2` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums3` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums4` are less than or equal to 268435456 and are greater than or equal to -268435456.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the product between the length of the integer array parameter `nums1`, the length of the integer array parameter `nums2`, the length of the integer array parameter `nums3`, and the length of the integer array parameter `nums4`.  
- The integer result is equal to the number of combinations in which the sum between one value from the integer array parameter `nums1`, one value from the integer array parameter `nums2`, one value from the integer array parameter `nums3`, and one value from the integer array parameter `nums4` is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [1,2] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [-2,-1] and the integer array parameter `nums3` is equal to [-1,2] and the integer array parameter `nums4` is equal to [0,2], the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums1` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums2` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums3` is equal to [0] and the integer array parameter `nums4` is equal to [0], the integer result is equal to 1.
