- The int[] `nums1`, int[] `nums2`, int[] `nums3`, and int[] `nums4` must each contain no fewer than 1 element and no more than 200 elements  
- The int[] `nums1`, int[] `nums2`, int[] `nums3`, and int[] `nums4` must all have identical length  
- Every element in int[] `nums1`, int[] `nums2`, int[] `nums3`, and int[] `nums4` must be greater than or equal to minus 268435456 and less than or equal to 268435456  
- The int result equals the number of index quadruples i j k l where i j k l are integers that are not less than zero and are less than the common length of the arrays and where nums1 at index i plus nums2 at index j plus nums3 at index k plus nums4 at index l equals zero
