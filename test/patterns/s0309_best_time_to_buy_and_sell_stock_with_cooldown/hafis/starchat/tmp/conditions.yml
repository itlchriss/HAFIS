ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the sum of the differences between adjacent elements in the type_integer_array_ param_prices_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_prices_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 5000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_prices_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
