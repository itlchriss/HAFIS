ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0.
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to the sum of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the type_integer_array_ param_prices_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_'s length is equal to 1 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 3.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_prices_ is sorted to the descending_order , the type_integer_ result is equal to 0.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_prices_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 5000.
- The type_integer_array_ param_prices_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to 0 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000.
