(15s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `prices` is less than or equal to 5000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `prices` are greater than or equal to 0 and are less than or equal to 1000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0.  
- The integer result is equal to the maximum total profit obtainable from the sequence of prices in the integer array parameter `prices` when any number of transactions may be performed under the conditions that a new buy cannot occur until the previous stock has been sold and that at least one full day elapses after each sell operation before another buy operation.  
- If the integer array parameter `prices` is equal to [1,2,3,0,2], the integer result is equal to 3.  
- If the integer array parameter `prices` is equal to [1], the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If every element of the integer array parameter `prices` is greater than or equal to the subsequent element, the integer result is equal to 0.
