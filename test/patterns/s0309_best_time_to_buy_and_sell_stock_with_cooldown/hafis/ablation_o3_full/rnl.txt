(9s elapsed)- The parameter "prices" of type int[] must contain at least one element and at most five thousand elements and each element must be an int value between zero and one thousand inclusive.  
- If the length of "prices" of type int[] is exactly one the result of type int equals zero.  
- The result of type int is never negative for any valid "prices" of type int[].  
- The result of type int equals the maximum profit that can be obtained from performing any number of buy and sell transactions on the daily values in "prices" of type int[] subject to the rule that a buy action cannot occur on the day immediately after a sell action and only one share may be held at any given time.
