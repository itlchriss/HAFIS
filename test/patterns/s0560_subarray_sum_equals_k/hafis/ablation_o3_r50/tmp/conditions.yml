ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is greater_than_or_equal to 0 and is less_than_or_equal to the quotient between the product between the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length and the sum between the type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length and 1 and 2.
- The type_integer_ result is equal to the total number of continuous subarrays of the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ whose sum is equal to the type_integer_ param_k_.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 2 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a and the type_integer_ param_k_ is equal to 3 , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000 and are less_than_or_equal to 1000.
- The type_integer_ param_k_ is greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000000 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000000.
