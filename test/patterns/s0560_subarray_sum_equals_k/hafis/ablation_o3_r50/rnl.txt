(15s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 20000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -1000 and are less than or equal to 1000.  
- The integer parameter `k` is greater than or equal to -10000000 and is less than or equal to 10000000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the quotient between the product between the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and the sum between the length of the integer array parameter `nums` and 1 and 2.  
- The integer result is equal to the total number of continuous subarrays of the integer array parameter `nums` whose sum is equal to the integer parameter `k`.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,1,1] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 2, the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3] and the integer parameter `k` is equal to 3, the integer result is equal to 2.
