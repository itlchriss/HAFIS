Drop-in the contract in front of the method that is supposed to solve the task.

```java
/**
 * Returns the number of (start,end) pairs such that
 *     0 ≤ start ≤ end < nums.length                 and
 *     Σ_{t=start..end} nums[t] == k.                (continuous sub-array sum)
 */

public static /*@ pure @*/ int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k);
```

Explanation of the main JML clauses:

• `requires` clauses encode the “Constraints” section (array size, value ranges, k-range, non-null).  
• `assignable \nothing` states the method is observationally pure.  
• The big `ensures` quantifier is the formal translation of “the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals k”.  
  - `(\num_of … )` counts how many tuples satisfy the given Boolean.  
  - `(\sum … )` is JML’s summation operator, giving the sum of that slice.

With this contract, any implementation that passes runtime or static JML checking is guaranteed to fulfill the exact problem specification.
