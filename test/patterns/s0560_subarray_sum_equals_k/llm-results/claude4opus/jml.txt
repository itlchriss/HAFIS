Here's the JML specification for the "Subarray Sum Equals K" problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    /*@ public normal_behavior
      @ requires nums != null;
      @ requires 1 <= nums.length && nums.length <= 20000;
      @ requires (\forall int i; 0 <= i && i < nums.length; 
      @           -1000 <= nums[i] && nums[i] <= 1000);
      @ requires -10000000 <= k && k <= 10000000;
      @ ensures \result >= 0;
      @ ensures \result == (\num_of int i, j; 0 <= i && i <= j && j < nums.length;
      @                     (\sum int m; i <= m && m <= j; nums[m]) == k);
      @ pure
      @*/
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

Key points about this JML specification:

1. **Preconditions (`requires`):**
   - `nums` is not null
   - Array length is between 1 and 20,000
   - Each element is between -1000 and 1000
   - `k` is between -10^7 and 10^7

2. **Postconditions (`ensures`):**
   - Result is non-negative (count of subarrays)
   - Result equals the count of all continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k`
   - Uses `\num_of` to count the number of valid (i,j) pairs where i is the start index and j is the end index of a subarray
   - Uses `\sum` to calculate the sum of elements from index i to j (inclusive)

3. **Method properties:**
   - Marked as `pure` since it doesn't modify any state
   - Uses `normal_behavior` since the method should not throw exceptions given valid inputs

The specification captures that we need to count all continuous subarrays (represented by start index i and end index j where i â‰¤ j) whose elements sum to exactly k.
