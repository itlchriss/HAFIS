ensures:
- The type_integer_ result is less_than_or_equal to 2147483647 and is greater_than_or_equal to negative 2147483648.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 2.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_nums_ is equal to arr_a , the type_integer_ result is equal to 16.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 100000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 1.
- The type_integer_array_ param_nums_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 1000000000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 1000000000.
