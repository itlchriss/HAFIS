(13s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is less than or equal to 100000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are less than or equal to 1000000000 and are greater than or equal to -1000000000.  
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to the maximum value of java integer.  
- If all values in the integer array parameter `nums` are equal, the integer result is equal to 0.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3], the integer result is equal to 2.  
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,10,2,9], the integer result is equal to 16.
