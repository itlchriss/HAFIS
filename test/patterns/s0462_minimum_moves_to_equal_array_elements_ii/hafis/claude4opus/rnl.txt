Based on the given software specification and following the established pattern from the examples, here are the method behavioural specifications:

- The length of the integer array parameter `nums` is greater than or equal to 1 and is less than or equal to 100000.
- All values in the integer array parameter `nums` are greater than or equal to -1000000000 and are less than or equal to 1000000000.
- The integer result is greater than or equal to 0 and is less than or equal to 2147483647.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,2,3], the integer result is equal to 2.
- If the integer array parameter `nums` is equal to [1,10,2,9], the integer result is equal to 16.
- If all values in the integer array parameter `nums` are equal, the integer result is equal to 0.
