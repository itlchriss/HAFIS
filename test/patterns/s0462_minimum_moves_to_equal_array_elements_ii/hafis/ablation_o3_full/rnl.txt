(9s elapsed)- The int[] parameter 'nums' must contain at least one element and at most one hundred thousand elements  
- Every value in int[] parameter 'nums' must be within minus one billion and one billion inclusive  
- The int result equals the minimum number of single unit increment or single unit decrement operations required to transform all values in 'nums' to the same value  
- The int result is always zero or positive  
- The int result always fits within the range supported by a signed thirty two bit integer
