    boolean canThreePartsEqualSum(int[] arr)

that must satisfy the problem statement “Partition Array Into Three Parts With
Equal Sum”.

```

Explanation of the major JML clauses

1. `requires`  
   • `arr != null` and `arr.length >= 3` come directly from the problem constraints  
   • The range check on the elements is commented-out because it is not
     strictly necessary for correctness, but can be kept if you want to reflect
     the original problem statement completely.

2. `ensures`  
   A bi-implication (`<==>`) is used so that the logical property and the
   returned value agree in both directions:  
   ­– If the method returns `true`, the existential condition must hold.  
   ­– If such indices exist, the method must return `true`; otherwise `false`.

3. `(\sum int k; P(k); E(k))`  
   This JML quantifier is used to express the sum of a segment succinctly.

4. `assignable \nothing` and `pure`  
   State that the method has no visible side effects; it only computes and
   returns a value.
