ensures:
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is partitioned into 3 consecutive non empty segments whose sums are equal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ cannot be partitioned into 3 consecutive non empty segments whose sums are equal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
