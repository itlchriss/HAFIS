(6s elapsed)Thinking... (7s elapsed)Thinking... (7s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 50000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to -10000 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1], the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer array parameter `arr` can be partitioned into three consecutive non empty segments whose sums are equal.  
- If the boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer array parameter `arr` cannot be partitioned into three consecutive non empty segments whose sums are equal.
