boolean result equals true if there exist 2 indexes i and j such that i + 1 is less_than to j and the contiguous elements from index 0 through i form the first non empty part and the contiguous elements from index i + 1 through j - 1 form the second non empty part and the contiguous elements from index j through the type_string_ strs_a.length - 1 form the third non empty part and the sums of the 3 parts are equal .
