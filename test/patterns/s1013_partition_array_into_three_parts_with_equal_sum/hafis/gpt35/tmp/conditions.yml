ensures:
- The type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal if we find indexes the type_string_ strs_a such that the summation from index 0 to i is equal to the summation from index i+1 to j-1 and is equal to the summation from index j to the end of the array.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s length is less_than_or_equal to 50000 and is greater_than_or_equal to 3.
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s values are less_than_or_equal to 10000 and are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000.
