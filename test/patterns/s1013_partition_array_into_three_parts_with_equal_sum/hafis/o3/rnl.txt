(15s elapsed)- The length of the integer array parameter `arr` is greater than or equal to 3 and is less than or equal to 50000.  
- All values in the integer array parameter `arr` are greater than or equal to -10000 and are less than or equal to 10000.  
- If boolean result is equal to the true literal, the integer array parameter `arr` can be split into three contiguous non empty sections such that the sum of the first section is equal to the sum of the second section and is equal to the sum of the third section.  
- If boolean result is equal to the false literal, the integer array parameter `arr` cannot be split into three contiguous non empty sections having equal sums.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1], the boolean result is equal to the false literal.  
- If the integer array parameter `arr` is equal to [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4], the boolean result is equal to the true literal.
