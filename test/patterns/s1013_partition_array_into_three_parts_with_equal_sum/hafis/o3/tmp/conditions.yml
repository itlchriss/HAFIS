ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is split into 3 contiguous non empty sections such that the sum of the first section is equal to the sum of the second section and is equal to the sum of the third section.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ cannot be split into 3 contiguous non empty sections having equal sums.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_integer_array_ param_arr_ is equal to arr_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_integer_array_ param_arr_'s values are greater_than_or_equal to negative 10000 and are less_than_or_equal to 10000.
