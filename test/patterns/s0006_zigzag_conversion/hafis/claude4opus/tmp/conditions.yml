ensures:
- The type_string_ result's length is equal to the type_string_ param_s_'s length.
- The type_string_ result contains all the same characters as the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 1 , the type_string_ result is equal to the type_string_ param_s_.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 3 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 4 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a and the type_integer_ param_numRows_ is equal to 1 , the type_string_ result is equal to stry_b.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000.
- The type_string_ param_s_ contains alphabets , comma and period .
- The type_integer_ param_numRows_ is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 1000.
