- The string parameter `s` consists only of English letters comma and period.  
- The integer parameter `numRows` is less than or equal to 1000 and is greater than or equal to 1.  
- The length of the string result is equal to the length of the string parameter `s`.  
- The string result consists only of English letters comma and period.  
- If the integer parameter `numRows` is equal to 1, the string result is equal to the string parameter `s`.  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "A" and the integer parameter `numRows` is equal to 1, the string result is equal to "A".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "PAYPALISHIRING" and the integer parameter `numRows` is equal to 3, the string result is equal to "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR".  
- If the string parameter `s` is equal to "PAYPALISHIRING" and the integer parameter `numRows` is equal to 4, the string result is equal to "PINALSIGYAHRPI".
