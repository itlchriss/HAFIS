    public static boolean isValid(String s)

that is expected to decide whether the argument `s` is a *valid parentheses*
string as described in the statement you supplied.  
Only the specification is given – the method bodies can be filled in any way
that satisfies the contract (they are marked *irrelevant for verification*).

Explanation of the salient points

1. Preconditions (`requires`)
   • `s` must exist, have length 1 … 10 000, and consist solely of the
   six bracket characters.

2. Postcondition (`ensures`)
   • The returned value is `true` exactly when the helper predicate
   `wellFormed` holds for the argument.

3. `wellFormed`
   • Is declared as a *pure model* function (it has no side-effects and
   need not be implemented).
   • Its contract encodes, with three existential cases, precisely the
   grammar that captures the two rules from the informal statement
     – matching bracket types   
     – correct nesting / ordering.

Any implementation of `isValid` that satisfies this contract is
guaranteed (by a JML-aware verifier) to solve LeetCode problem 20
correctly while respecting the given constraints.
