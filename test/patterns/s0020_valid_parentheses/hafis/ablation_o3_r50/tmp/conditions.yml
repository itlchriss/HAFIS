ensures:
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , each opening bracket in the type_string_ param_s_ is closed by the same type of bracket and the closures are contained by the correct order.
- If type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal , at least 1 opening bracket in the type_string_ param_s_ is not closed by the same type of bracket or the closures do not are contained by the correct order.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains leftp rightp leftb rightb leftbp rightbp.
