ensures:
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
- If the type_string_ param_s_ is equal to stry_a , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , every opening bracket in the type_string_ param_s_ has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
- If the type_boolean_ result is equal to the true literal , all brackets in the type_string_ param_s_ are closed in the correct order.
- If the type_string_ param_s_'s length is odd , the type_boolean_ result is equal to the false literal.
requires:
- The type_string_ param_s_'s length is greater_than_or_equal to 1 and is less_than_or_equal to 10000.
- The type_string_ param_s_ only contains the checking_character_sequence_ .
